Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel recommended thinking about the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss defining conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts," said Grindel the "Picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most dangerous to Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one does not come around the debate whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of associations that want to break into this phalanx. "
He has doubts whether the German Football League is willing to allow majority stakes prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the business location of the Bundesliga in a European single market," said Grindel.
The former DFB head sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at the European level but do not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV funds will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.

Arrived professionally - privately not yet
"It's going super well" - this conclusion is drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notary in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very fast: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will be the successor of Lutz Feller at the Eggengenfelden.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctorate lawyer began the work, the normal daily business has long been on full tours.
"However, I still must arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time has of course been not enough to completely move the focal point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, the native dingolin finger reports.
Currently, she with her husband, who works as a judge at the district court, is looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city.
At least her husband could still apply for parental leave, in order to ensure care of the two daughters (3 ½ and 1 ½ years old).
To not have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Growing up in the neighboring district, the city of Eggenfelden has been a known for a long time.
During visits with her family in the past few months, she has found again: "Eggenfelden is a beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had won the race in the selection process.
Her homeland of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying in the law in Passau, she completed her referendarial period and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen im Unterallgäu and in Regensburg - during this time she also bestowed "by the by-side" the doctorate in labour law - in 2012 she took her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau.
In 2016 she went on parental leave, and she finally moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representative services in various notary offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden had been advertised because of the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she had seen the right time for the full professional re-entry, the 39-year-old explains.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer took the team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary office in the future - and has immediately prepared a praise for the law firm's team: "It runs super well!"
That she can rely on well-established processes here makes it easier for her to look after the upcoming shift of the private focus.
In terms of kindergarten or crib places, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Red ot.
BVB plans to start league with maximum 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the case of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which is to be observed, we are planning with 12,000 to 15spectators at the current level," said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer to the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena holds slightly more than 81,000 spectators in Bundesliga matches.
In the last season ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic, the BVB had lost around four million euros per game.
The Cramer at BVB for marketing, digitalization and internationalization hopes that in addition to the normal spectators, some of the approx. 4000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened once again: "It is of course a blow into the Kontor, if these revenues break away completely".
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, all are currently "well advised to take a stable side for the first time".
"If many companies don't work well and 6.8 million people are in short work in Germany alone, the need is limited to entertainment," Cramer explained.
The Dortmund Marketing Director praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary, which should contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, players know that their salary waiver has a different effect, rather than putting short-term work to 100 people working in merchandising."

They are so small and born so early that neither lungs nor intestines, nor muscles are fully trained.

Kalbitz-ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the viewpoint of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change anything about the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD, "said the FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The federal arbitration court of the AfD confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of trial the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD faction in the Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AfD were really a question of removing right-wing extremists away from its party consistently, officials such as BjÃ1 nn Höcke and his supporters would have long since been expelled," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD, because right-wing extremism now belongs to the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is remain excluded now says nothing does not change anything," he said to the "World on Sunday".
"It speaks volumes, how many frenetic supporters still a far-right has in the middle of the AfD."
Blume assumes that the AfD will once again land for less than five per cent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are counted".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and group chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies stronation as a "secured right-wing extremist effort".
In May, the AfD chairman threw Kalbitz from the party.
As a reason he stated that in his party entry Kalbitz had not stated earlier membership in the now bannbidden far-right "home-faithful German Youth" (HDHD) and among the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies the membership of the HDJ.
The chairman of the Left fraction in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change anything about the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a right-wing party, whether with or without Kalbitz ".
Neither this decision will be used to weaken the federal party nor the right wing.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troops is clear.
We want to avoid further observation by the constitutional protection and try to get through under the radar, "said Walter.
"The AfD will not release the spirits she called.
An ejection does not change anything yet, "Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn commented on the decision in Kalbitz case.
"Here, the AfD national association and the group still held their right-wing leader."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms <unk> 21 percent <unk>
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is about 21 percent more than in the same period last year, the network operator Tennet reported in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for transferring the North Sea electricity to the mainland and forwarding through the German electricity grid.
The wind bines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have an additional 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) electricity.
In total, wind power from the North and Baltic Sea amounts to 13.73 TWh, compared to over 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, representing about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy, in addition to the wind conditions, results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have gone to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all run with full power at the same time, they could calculatively generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatt.
By 2030 it will reach 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we will to invest EUR 20 billion in the expansion of offshore network connections," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms can not exploit their capacity even at sea, but can reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.

Turin - After a redemption of Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has won the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team finished the 36th Scudetto in club history with a 2 – 0 (1 – 0) on Sunday evening in the home match against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1 – 0 before the half.
With 83 points, Turin, without the last injured former player Sami Khedira, is not to take one place two days before the end of the season.
The Inter Milan table is back seven points.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo met after a free kick variant with the last action.
A supporting game by Miralem Pjanic used the 35-year-old directly from the penal border with a flat shot (45. + 7).
Ronaldo was also involved in 2 – 0 against the more offensive guests, and after his shot dusted Federico Bernardeschi (67.).
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but decisive success.
The 89th minute foulelmeter shot at the bte should have properly worn only Ronaldo himself in view of the goal hunter rating.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very slightly, "explained coach Maurizio Sarri still after the 1: 2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players was great, said the Juve Coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turiner had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve had the ultimately reassuring lead at the top of the table was mainly due to the weakness of the competitors.
In the eleven games before the match on Sunday, the Sarri-team only five wins.
Whether Ronaldo becomes a scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar so far scored 31 goals, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals on his account after his triple pack at 5: 1 (1: 1) of the table fourth Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many, as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current juve-pro Gonzalo Higuaín.
In the 2015 / 2016 season, the Argentine scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples.
In August the "Old Lady" of Italian football awaits the next title chance.

Baden-Württemberg: <unk> than 250 illegal <unk> <unk> <unk>
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court judgments, car drivers continue to give gas in the countless illegal races on the Strestreets of Baden-Württemberg: The police have already registered more than 250 illegal car races in the southwest last year and the first four months of this year.
Although there are no comparisons for the years before, the Rasers are increasingly working with judicial authorities: in the public prosecutors between Konststanz and Mannheim, a total of 155 investigations were conducted for illegal races, one year later it were already in 252, and 151 151 year until the beginning of June.
The races were less about organized events, as appears from the response of the Interior Ministry to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers had spontaneously faced each other or they had taken the escape from the police - this is also shown as an illegal race.
The wheel was driven by German men aged between 18 and 60.
113 <unk> <unk> <unk> 15 times <unk> <unk>
Only in comparatively few cases are the raids caught and asked to checkout: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 liberty sentences.
There is no evidence, however, that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers responded more sensitive than before due to several tragic accidents and processes of past years and indicated more frequently, a ministry spokesman said.
Again and again, motorists slow down the traffic there in order to gain space and use the free distance for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months before there were 18 riders on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit it is tried to slow out the raids on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and smoared sports and luxury carcuses often have Swiss plates, because the drivers dodge to lawn to Germany because of the high penalties for fast driving and car racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced on a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour we would solve this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivovoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for Raser would be significantly higher if you were not likely to be travelling here and there legally with 200 kilometers per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of enlightenment or campaigns: "Those who tranthemselves beyond all the driving rules in such a way risk not only their own life, but also the lives of other road users, can hardly be attainable with reason."
ADAC <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The ADAC, however, is not enough: "We assume that Rasers will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Department Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional as well as tougher controls on the affected routes.
It quite often becomes painful and extremely serious from the high-tourtouring measurement of forces: Since January 2019 and until April 2020 three people died nationwide died in the races, two of them uninvolved in a night-time crash in Stuttgart's downtown Stuttgart and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have delivered a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came from the road, crashed against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 more people have been injured over the past two years.
However, according Strobl's Interior Minister, sharper penalties are not necessary: "The need for legislative action, in order to harder sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder, is not seen" in the paper of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

North Korea Disclosels Border City after Corona Suspicion
North Korea has so far seen a "shining success" in its own measures to defend the coronavirus.
Now the country reports a case of suspicion for the first time.
Because of the first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely sealed a large city in fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the stringent epidemiological defense measures over the past six months, "the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
The state of emergency was imposed for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership proclaimed the highest level of alarm.
If the suspected case was confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the secoff country.
North Korea had not registered a single infection according to its own data and described all its defence measures as "luminous success".

According to the reports, the symptoms of disease occurred in an "outbreak" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had moved to South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
For the border crossing within the four kilometers wide and largely still mined military buffer zone there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
According to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military granted the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.

North Korea reported that on Saturday, due to suspicion, North Korea called an urgent meeting of the Labour Party Politbureau chaired by leader Kim Jong Un.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe."
Kim had already ordered Friday as a preventive measure to "fully block Kaesong and isolate each district and region from others," it continued.
The person concerned as well as all people in Kaesong, who had had contact with her, had been quarantined.
The central military commission of the party is therefore to investigate the "outar fall" as well as the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose hard punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Suspense before Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still under discussion before a great summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote among other things on the development plan for the large-scale project City city Development East project," it says rather casual in the middle part of the urban press release for the next council meeting on Tuesday Tuesday 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the Congress Centre Pforzheim.
However, the appreciation of the eastern city is mainly discussed controversial until the end.
The majority of this are scarce, recently rejected in individual committees, depending on the presence.
An appeal out of the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), the project now developed from the citizenship and then from administration administration and municipal council not to fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponents Reinhard Klein as a "non-parliamentary opposition", "unsuspecting", "" speculation "," defamation "and" conscious false statements ".
"Everyone means to know it better," says Klein, who has belonged to the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the citizens list Pforzheim.
In fact, after reading the Treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I am talking about."
The exit of the city is cheaper, the technical town hall is contrary to statements made by the city administration after subsidies, whose existence of Klein is convinced to repair for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than one predicted in the town hall and by the supporters of the economy.
To shape the city by its own strength and not an investor: this is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED Group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides for the rehabilitation of the technical town hall, the open keeping of the castle's mountain, the rental of the former valley for administrative areas and a smaller part inner city redesign, ideally with local carriers.
<unk> <unk> play a <unk> role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
The Municipal Council will, among other things, vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health pollution, caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent because this must come so because they have only contributed the massive increase in car traffic and thus to the noise by neglecting of bus traffic with thinned cycles and by little commitment to bicycle traffic.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
Furthermore, the agenda includes the accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the State of Baden-Württemberg, the redefinition of parental contributions in the urban day care facilities and the application for inclusion in the Smart City funding of the Federal Government.
Citizens are welcome but must heed Corona protection measures.

In 2015 he was a guest at Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have much to get used to the track," says Mr. Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafener Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many quick passages that you have to meet optimally to be fast".
How fast carpenter then then really is, that turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams poke a little bit during the tests," he says.
"In the end, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely crowded calendar.
Seven races will run until early November.

Virorologists mainly blame the nightlife for the new spread.
Spain is one of the favorite holiday countries of the British.
The British government currently advises against unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, the among British holidaymakers particularly popular Canary Islands and Balearic Islands are excluded from this.
So far, more than 272,000 infections have been registered in Spain with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 dead.

New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg drew attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans in the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she shook her.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children go to the street," she experienced.
Heads of state and leading politicians who mock against them in social media or even trying to silence them, find them "funny" as they show them the reactions "since they have no other answer"..
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she took a bitter look after US President Trump.

His life was like a rollercoaster ride: After a rapid climb with the Fleetwood Mac it went steeply downhill and then slowly upup.
Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73, told family members on Saturday in an official statement that a further statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton paid a tribute to Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, but still unforgotten is his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross".
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
There has been dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the group's profits for charity.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychic problems are also said to have played a role.
Three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.

The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time Green was treated in psychiatry.
During the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish workers' family in Bethnal Green, London.
At a young age, he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play guitar guitar and five years later the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Soon he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton at the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 with his bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave it the first number-one hit in the winter of 1968 / 69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed his shadow sides: Green did not handle the media bustle, his experiments with the drug LSD became ever more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction diction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is drugs - the best was to land a number 1 hit."
By the end of the decade, Green had surprisingly achieved an eighth success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac will meanwhile swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not make major comeback until he restarted with a group of friendly musicians in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke of a rock star returning to Earth.
Free of drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band broke up in 2004.
For music experts he was a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his gentle sound was one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
