A total of 174 harvesters were tested positive for the Corona pathogen, Sars-CoV-2, during the series examination, according to the Dingolfing-Landau office on Saturday evening.

Previously, seven employees had already become infected - this was the occasion of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural municipality with a good 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to citizens to maintain calm: "According to our information, it is a closed group of people".
On the farm infected were separated by uninfected employees, the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.

The SPD looks very similar to this: "After the Corona eruption in the Wiesenhof-slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvesters," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"In our view, the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions in particular must be sharply controlled.

According to a media report, Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for extended data retention - instead of the planned ten weeks half a year.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a quick change in law.

The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has frightened up authorities and politics.

The farm is now quarantined and is closed with a building fence.
Nobody is allowed to leave the site, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the 3,300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the district office has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Gewissensbisse": confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client was cooperative," said the newspaper's lawyer Quentin Chabert.
The defender added, "He very much regrets the deeds, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "plagued by remorse and very taken away from the extent of the destruction".
In the event of a conviction, according to the prosecutor's office, the man is threatened with ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in Nantes had been severely damaged by a fire on the night of Saturday last week.
The fire had erupted in three distant places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The now imprisoned suspect had been arrested a few hours after the fire.

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 50 + <unk> rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts," said Grindel the "picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the clubs, which can most likely become dangerous to Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, it is not around the debate whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors for clubs who want to break into this phalanx ".
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority shareholdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
"There remains a legal risk of drawing investment fences around the Bundesliga in a European internal market as a business location," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but do not lead to more excitement in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of the TV funds will not achieve a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern makes sales of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig 300 million.
So the differences are immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average 130 million, "said the 58-year-old.

"Unfortunately, there were people who noticed this mistake and pierced the press instead of addressing it," said Grindel about the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.

He received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.

He had never "made a secret out of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".

It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But even though the big party mile in the city center was lacking, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale were burning, Rakoczyball or procession, many got their money's worth in the Corona compliant alternative program.

Professional cyclist Tony Martin: Career continuation imaginable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin thinks about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt / Main - The seven time time trial world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I have the framework conditions with the team on how and in what form it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.

In the past, he got up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Quickly back to the wheel.
Today I think as the father of a little daughter: What if ".
The cyclist admitted that there are aspects with which he is increasingly difficult.
"But it was good for me to remember what I have about cycling and how much fun I was based on the Corona time."
The time trial specialist returns to the competition event at the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).

The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer viable under the current conditions.
Argentina therefore calls on its private creditors to waive some of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the country faces bankruptcy again.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.

"It's going super well" - this conclusion is drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notary in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very fast: In the middle of May Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfeldener Notariatsstelle.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer started the work, the normal daily business has long been running on full speed.
"However, I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time, of course, was not enough to shift the center of life from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
She is currently her husband, who is working in Regensburg as a judge at the district court, looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was still able to apply for parental leave at short notice to ensure the care of the two daughters (3 ½ and 1 ½ years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been familiar to it.
During visits on site with her family in recent months, she has again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her native in Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying the law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assesser, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "incidentally trained" her doctorate in labour law - she took her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, followed by moving to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial positions.
When the job in Eggenfelden was advertised for the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she had seen the right time for full professional re-entry, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of its predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary office, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and has a praise for the team of the law firm: "It is going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private center of life.
She has already contacted a local institution in terms of kindergarten and crib places.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent filled at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance control, which must be complied with, we are planning, according to current status with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the Revierstadt holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic last season, BVB had lost around four million euros per game.
The cramer responsible for marketing, digitalization and internationalization at the BVB hopes that in addition to the normal spectators, some of the approximately 4000 places in the hospitality area can also be opened: "It is, of course a blow into the office if these revenues break away completely".
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to occupy a stable length of the side".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany are in short-time work alone, then the need is limited to entertainment," explained Cramer.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB professionals for their salary partial waiver, which is to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than when we put 100 people working in merchandising in merchandising".

They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully developed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothing and specially made mini diapers for them.

Calbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the perspective of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD, "said the FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday after several hours, the AfD Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided on by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD were really interested with consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, functionaries such as Björn Höcke and his supporters would long have been expelled," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism now belongs to the party".
Similarly, CSU General Secretary Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told the "world on Sunday".
"Rather, it speaks volumes of how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist continues to have in the middle of the AfD."
Blume assumes that the AfD will land less than five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially disbanded "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Björn Höcke; the Protection of the Constitution classifies the coronation as "secure right-wing extremist striation".
In May, the AfD federal board threw Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated an earlier membership in the now forbidden right-wing extremist "Home-loyal German Youth" (HDJ) and with the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies HDJ membership.
The chairman of the left group in the Brandenburg parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the federal arbitral court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has eaten only chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz ".
Neither the federal party is weakened nor the right wing is with this decision.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuten troupe is visible.
One wants to avoid further observation by the Federal Protection of the Constitution and try to get through under the radar, "said Walter.
"The AfD doesn't get rid of the ghosts she called.
A expulsion does not change anything yet, "Brandenburg SPD General General Erik Stohn commented on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD state association and the faction still held their right-wing leader".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, network operator Tennet announced in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and the forwarding through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, fed another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind power from the North and Baltic Seas thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind flow in Germany; that is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
<unk> <unk> farms <unk> <unk>
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy results in addition to the wind conditions from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have gone to the grid over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatt.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we have been investing 20 billion euros by then in the expansion of offshore grid connections," said Tennis Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day to date this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.

"But in the end, as organizers, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
If tens of thousands had flowed to the festival grounds and to the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking could not have been lied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.

So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training makes a significant contribution to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, it is not economically easy for us to promote.

Rescue screwdriver lands on the A 45
For about 30 minutes, the A 45 motorway was fully closed on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopter was in use after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove straight with a Ford at around 12.40 a.m. at the exit Alzenau-Mitte in the bend and landed on the guardrail.
Due to the impact, the front tairbags triggered, the driver suffered minor injuries on the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The 72-year-old passenger's injuries were treated by the emergency doctor and the patient then flown to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused a damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed.
Heil wants to test other industries according to the meat industry
The Corona crisis once again brought to light the conditions in parts of the meat industry.

But are they right <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) also wants to review other industries according to the now planned strict regulations against grievances in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry for the industry and then take suitable measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers already warn against restricting works contracts in general.
After the mass Corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Großschlachtereien should no longer be allowed to employ external personnel in slaughter, dismantling and meat processing.
To this end, the use of work contracts and temporary workers there is to be banned.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and the render of workers, if one does not want to completely stranggle the economy".
Factory contracts are, for example, the basis for their added value for the customer for wide areas of trade, the construction industry and plant engineering.
"The misconduct of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to prohibit works treaties everywhere in the German economy."
<unk> contracts <unk> <unk> <unk>
"If an industrial company orders a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a normal contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on works contracts and temporary agency work to be unconstitutional in its industry alone.
It can not be explained why other labour law should apply to cheese portioning and packaging cheese in in future than to sausage, according to a statement on the legislative project, as the Neue Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung (Saturday) reports.
With a ban, the consumer price would therefore increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.

It was also noted that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.

But these were bypassed by "tricky constructions".
"Now must be cleaned up".
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Safety and Safety Act, which we want to decide in the cabinet at the end of July, are measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher test rates in occupational safety or clear criteria for Community shelters".
The draft before the dpa includes amendments to the Act on Securing Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Safety Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I would like us to be able to take even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example, animal transports," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB programme "Brandenburg aktuell".

Turin - After a redemping goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world football perfect perfect the 36th Scudetto of the club history with a 2-0 (1-0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1 – 0 before the halfway.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the last injured former international Sami Khedira, is no longer displaced from first place two match days before the end of the Serie A season.
The Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo met the last action after a free kick variant.
The 35-year-old used a playback of Miralem Pjanic directly from the penal area limit with a shx shot (45th + 7).
Ronaldo was also involved in 2: 0 against the now more offensive guests, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted.
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but decisive success.
The foul meter shot at the latte in the 89th minute may only have properly ed Ronaldo himself with a view to the Torjäger classification.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very slightly, "explained coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1: 2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turin had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end, Juve owed the reassuring lead at the top of the table above all to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the match on Sunday, the Sarriteam had succeeded in only five victories.
Whether Ronaldo becomes top scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile already scored 34 goals on his account after his pack of three at the 5: 1 (1-1) of the standstandfourth Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The current juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015 – 2016 season.
In August the next title chance awaits the "Old Lady" of Italian football.
Juventus reached the round of 16 of the Champions League, but has to make up for a 1-0 first round against Olympique Lyon on 7 August to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg <unk> <unk> 250 <unk> <unk> <unk>
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court judgments, drivers continue to accelerate on countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police have already registered more than 250 illegal car races in the southwest.
Although there are no comparable figures for the years before, the speazers are increasingly working for the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted at the prosecution between Konstanz and Mannheim due to illegal races, a year later it was already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The races were less about organized events, as is seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers had spontaneously competed against each other or they had fled from the police - this is also indicated as an illegal race.
The wheel was mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.

Only in comparatively few cases are the speazers caught and also asked to pay out: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been imposed.
However, there are no indications that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitive than before because of the several tragic accidents and processes of past years and indicated more often, a ministerial spokesman said.
Again and again, motorists brake down traffic there to make space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 riders on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit, attempts are made to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and ppewed sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers dodge the lawn to Germany because to the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few distances: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would create this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speazers would be significantly higher if you should not be legally on the road here and there with 200 kilometers per hour and more".
Rivoir considers less of enlightenment or image campaigns: "Those who disregard all rules in such a way and not only puts their own lives, but also the lives of other road users at risk are hardly attainable with reason".
ADAC <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
On the other hand, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that speazers can not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and the Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also harder controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed showdown becomes painful and momentous serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people died nationwide in the races, two of them were involved in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city center and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men are said to have a car race.
One of the vehicles came off the road, clashed a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people have been injured in the races of the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, sharpener penalties are not necessary: "Legislature need for action in order to sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder is not seen," according to the Ministry of the Interior.

North Korea locks off border town after Corona case of suspicion
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to defend the coronavirus a "luminous success".
Now, for the first time, the country is reporting on a suspected case.
Due to a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a big city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defensive measures over the past six months, "the vicious virus may have been introduced to the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the state of emergency had been imposed.
The communist leadership proclaimed the highest alarm level.
Should the suspected case be confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea had not yet registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as a "luminous success".

The symptoms of the disease reportedly were found in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person left for South Korea three years ago and now returned across the border.
For the border crossing within the four kilometers wide and mostly mined military buffer zone there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
However, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea ’ s military acknowledged the possibility of illegal illegal crossing to North Korea as high.

According to North Korea, an urgent meeting of the Politburo of the Labour Party, chaired by ruler Kim Jong Un, called on Saturday due of suspicion.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could cause a deadly and destructive catastrophe".
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "completely block Kaesong and isolate every district and region from others," it continued.
The person concerned and all people in Kaesong who had contact with her had been quarantined.
The central military commission of the party should therefore investigate the "outbreak" as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose harsh punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension before Council meeting: City east and noise protection are still under discussion before a great summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the major project Innenstadtentwicklung-Ost," says rather casually in the middle section of the municipal press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrPforzheim.
However, the appreciation of the eastern city, however, is controversial until the end.
The majorities for this are scarce, most recently in individual committees even negative depending on the presence.
An appeal from business (construction, real estate, trade and IT), the project developed from the citizenship and then by administration and the municipal council now not let now fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponents Reinhard Klein as an "non-parliamentary opposition", "unsuspecting", "speculation", "denigration" and "conscious false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know it better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizen list.
In fact, after reading the Treaties, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit is cheaper for the city, the Technical Town Hall, contrary to statements made by the city administration, according to grants, the existence of which Klein is convinced to be renovated for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than is forecast in the town hall and by supporters of business.
To design the city through its own power and not an investor: This is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It essentially also envisages the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the disclosure of the Schloßberg, the rental of the former valley for administrative areas and a small-scale inner center redesign ideally with local carriers.
Environmental <unk> <unk>
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Thus, among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of the Pforzheim from health noise pollution, caused by road traffic, including temporary reduction.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of tempo / 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent the fact that this must come so because they have only contributed to the VCD by neglecting regular traffic traffic with thinned cycles and by little commitment to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the traffic, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also coordinates on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the restoration of the parental contributions in the urban day-care institutions and the application for admission to the smart city funding of the federal government.
Citizens are welcome, but they need to take care of Corona protection measures.

The GT Masters will also host its first race right there - at Lausitzring.

British Transport Minister cold caught quarantine decision
According to press reports, the British government's decision to quarantine Spanish holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has cold caught the country's minister of transport.
Accordingly, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues decided on the measure at home on Saturday.
Because of the rising Corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of those countries from which entry without quarantine requirements is possible.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are only on holiday on the deadline, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Spain is so far considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Numerous ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that quarantine for holidaymakers will be imposed on Spain," commented Labour MEP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has made the effort to tell Grant Shapps."
Less than a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, the number of infection in the country increases again.
Virologists above all blame the nightlife for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the dearest holiday countries of the British.
The British government currently advises against unnecessary travel to mainland Spain, with the exception of the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 dead have been registered in Spain.

Greta Thunberg: Evil gaze against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg talked about meeting US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known Latenight show via video and in an interview what she had in mind during her encounter with Donald Trump.
Climate kivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US latight show via video switch.
Among other things, she told about her fight against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous "evil look" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known Latenight show about her plans in the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
She talked not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to focus on the climate crisis," she shook.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children take to the streets" she experienced.
Heads of state and leaders who mock against them on social media or even try to silence them find them "funny" because they show them the reactions "because they have no other answer to them".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was referred to a well-known scene in which US President Trump took a bitterly evil look.
At the 2019 UN climate Summit in New York, for which the Aktvistin sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, i.e. an animated image, which ultimately became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment?
To the relatively disclosed question of Stephen Colbert, she replied only briefly and dry: "To be honest, I believe that this requires no further explanation".
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected with the quick-ready answer and disappeared briefly laughing from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.

His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac it went steeply downhill and then slowly up.
Now blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult pendant: The co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, told family members on Saturday in an official statement that another statement was announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton paid tribute to Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke of a "monumental loss" emotional response for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the long-legendary band in London in 1967, and his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is still unforgettable.
"The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
There are said to have been disputes, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group for charity.
He began to perform in wide garments and with a large crucifix.

Three years after its inception, Green left the band in 1970.

The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time Green was treated in psychiatry.
During a large part of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived temporarily on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946, the son of a Jewish working-class family in Bethnal Green.
At a young age, he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
He was later hired to replace his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac with his bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie in the summer of 1967.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave the group the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968 / 69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid ascent soon showed his dark sides: Green did not cope with the media bustle, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing happened to me in life are the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprising success of success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
