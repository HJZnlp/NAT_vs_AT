He stressed : &quot; For the clubs that can most likely be dangerous to Bavaria and Dortmund , 50 + 1 rules do not work anyway : see Leipzig or Leverkusen .
In this respect , one does not get around the debate whether it is not necessary to facilitate clubs who want to break into this phalanx the involvement of investors &quot; .
has doubts about whether in German football there is to allow majority participdings , which are in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule .

The former DFB boss sees the danger that &quot; the attempts to ensure more competition balance in the Bundesliga , in the end only competitiveness of top clubs at European level , but no longer lead to in the championship &quot; .
Even an equal distribution of the TV funds will achieve a decisive effect .
&quot; FC Bayern makes sales of 750 million euros , Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig 300 million
So the differences are immense among the first three clubs alone .

She was all the more pleased that she did the selection process for the vacancies .
Her home country of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer &apos;s professional career : After studying the law in Passau , she completed her legal traineeship and the 2nd in Regensburg .
After several positions as a notary assesser , including Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia , Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also &quot; incidentally trained &quot; her doctorate - she took her first position notary in Rotthalmünster district of Passau in 2012 .
In 2016 , she went on parental leave , followed by moving to Regensburg .
Since then she has taken over representation services in various notarial positions
When the job in Eggenfelden was advertised because of the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller , she saw the right time for the full professional return , the 39-year-old explains
The team predecessor , who takes over the holiday representation in the , has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely and has a praise for the team of the law firm ready : &quot; It runs super well ! &quot;
The fact that this can rely on well-rehearsed processes makes it easier to take care of the upcoming shift in the private center of life .

Kalbitz-ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of fig leaf
From the perspective of the FDP , exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a &quot; fig leaf &quot; and does not change the character of the party .
&quot; The AfD is the parliamentary arm of right-wing extremists in Germany .
Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD , &quot; said the FDP politician Benjamin Strasser of the dpa in Berlin .
the AfD had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of trial , which majority of the federal board had decided in May .
is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburger Landtag .
&quot; If the AfD really wanted to consistently getting right-wing extremists out of their party , Björn Höcke and his would have been expelled &quot; , Strasser .
However , there is no political will in the AfD , because right-wing extremism is now becoming a party &quot; .
Similarly , CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said : &quot; The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not change anything , &quot; he told the &quot; world on Sunday &quot; .
&quot; Rather , it speaks volumes of how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist continues to have in the middle of the AfD . &quot;
Blume assumes that the AfD will end up less than five percent in elections in the future .
The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted &quot; .
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the meanwhile dissolved &quot; wing around the Thuringian AfD state group chairman BjBjörn ; the Protection of the Constitution classifies the coronation as &quot; secure right-wing extremist aspiration &quot; .
In May , the AfD federal board Kalbitz was thrown out of the party .
As a reason he stated that Kalbitz had not stated in his former membership in the meanwhile forbidden far-right &quot; German Youth &quot; ( HDJ ) and with the Republicans .

The chairman Linksfraktion in the Brandenburg Landtag , Sebastian Walter , and the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court do not change the AfD character : &quot; The wolf has eaten only chalk .
The AfD remains a far-right party , whether with or without Kalbitz &quot; .
Neither this decision becomes the federal party nor the right wing .

One wants to avoid further observation by the Protection of the Constitution and to get through under the radar , Walter said .
&quot; The AfD doesn &apos;t release the spirits she called .
Ejection does not change anything yet , &quot; commented the Brandenburg SPD Secretary-General decision in the case of Kalbitz .
&quot; Here the AfD state association held the faction as its right-wing leader to this day &quot; .
The legal dispute over Kalbitz &apos;s membership in the AfD will continue
He announced on Saturday that he would be taking action against those of the Federal Arbitration Court .
North Sea wind farms deliver 21 percent more electricity

The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea , which are not part of Tennet &apos;s grid area , fed another 2.22 terawatt hours ( TWh of electricity .
Overall , the wind power from the North and Baltic Seas thus comes to 13.73 TWh , compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019 .

The transmission capacity is sufficient for this ; according to Tennet , it is 7.1 gigawatt .
So far it is to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German .

Because of the defeat , the Turin still managed the championship perfectly .
In the end , Juve owed the reassuring lead at the top of the table above all to the weakness of the competitors .
In the eleven games before the Sunday match , the Sarriteam had only five victories .
Whether Ronaldo becomes top scorer is questionable .
While the Portuguese superstar scored 31 goals so far , the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile already has 34 on his account after his three-pack at 5 : 1 ( 1 : 1 ) of the fourth Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - just as Lewandowski contributed the title win of FC Bayern .

Stuttgart - All threatened penalties and motorists accelerate on countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads : Last year , the first four months of this year , the police already registered more than 250 illegal car races in the southwest .

The races are less about organized events , as is seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtag SPD .
In most cases , the drivers competed against each other or they had fled from the police also this is also an illegal race .

Rather , because of the several tragic accidents and processes of past years more sensitive than before and indicated , a ministerial spokesman said .

For the SPD , the speed limit must not be reduced to a few distances : &quot; With a general speed limit of kilometres per hour , we would create this problem for motorways , &quot; says Martin Rivoir of the transport expert SPD parliamentary group
&quot; That would be significantly higher for razers if you should not be on the road here and there still legally with kilometers per hour and more &quot; .

Not infrequently , the high-touring showof strength becomes painful and more serious : January 2019 to April 2020 , three people died nationwide in the races , including two uninvolved in a crash Stuttgart Stuttgart city center and one in Gerlingen .
Two young men are said to have a car race in November .
One of the vehicles came off the road , crashed against one and remained lying , the 18-year-old passenger died .
21 other people have been injured in the races of the past two years .
