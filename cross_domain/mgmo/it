Anjuta -@ manual

Johannes Schmidjhs @ gnome.org

Anjuta is a versatile integrated development environment ( IDE ) for the GNOME -@ desktop . It provides a variety of advanced development methods such as project management , program wizard , an interactive debugger , the surface designer Glade , the API -@ Help Devhelp , the memory -@ Profiler Valgrind , the performance -@ Profiler gprof , a class generator , a powerful source editor , source code -@ browser and more .
in the following screenshot you see some of what you will encounter in Anjuta .
please report all the problems they encounter when using Anjuta - this will help to improve the software as well as the Open -@ Source -@ community .
first steps with Anjuta
Menus and
At the top of the Anjuta # -@ main window is the menu bar . Through allows almost the entire functionality of Anjuta is accessible by menu items . Actions have been divided depending on the type .

Anjuta . -@ menu bar .
Menu &quot; File &quot;
Key shortcuts are available for many menu items . all key combinations are displayed next to the assigned menu item . Some more helpful key combinations are listed here
Change editor page : Ctrl AltBild ↑ ( forward ) and Ctrl AltBild ↓ ( backward ) . You can also switch pages by right-clicking on the tab and selecting a file name from the pop-up menu ( this is useful if all tab are not immediately visible ) . Some working environments may have assigned these key combinations , in this case you need to document them ( not in Anjuta ) if you want to use them in Anjuta .
Context help : ShiitF1 . Move the input character over the word ( e.g. a function name ) for which you want to call the ar -@ Help API , and use this key combination . Context help only works if Devhelp is installed ; otherwise , the Contt menu and the button is in the toolbar . You can purchase Devhelp from the Devhelp -@ web page . You you must also install the associated Devhelp for-@ books .
Automatic completion : Ctrl Input key . Position the input character exactly behind an incomplete word and use this key combination . A list of possible completwill is displayed on it .
more key shortcuts : look for key combinations that are displayed to the right of menu entries .
Adjust the keyboard shortcuts
Keyshortcuts can be changed under Editing Settings in the Key Shortcuts tab .

the main window contains several view windows , which can be rearranged by dragging their respective title bar .
The document window has only one document active ( when files are open ) . all file commands affect the active document . You can switch to each open document by clicking on the respective tab . You can also do the same in which you right-click on any tab and select the desired document from the appearing pop-up window . This is especially useful if many files are open , but not all associated file riders are visible .
the project window contains the tree of the project files when a project is open , otherwise the project window is usually hidden . a double-clicking on any object in the project window opens this file .
The file window contains a file tree . If no project is open , the file tree usually shows the top folder of the file system . However , this can be adjusted in the settings . if a project is open , all files of the project are displayed in the window . A double-click on a file opens it with the corresponding application , as it is specified in the GNOME MIME -@ settings .
the symbol window shows a tree of the available symbols in the project , which is formed by processing the ctags .
there is also a search der in the symbol window where you can search for symbols .
The message window displays all output ( both stdout and stderr ) when an external command is executed . The message window is usually hidden , but is displayed when external commands are executed , such as compiling a file or the project , error analysis , search , and many other operations .
Messages in the preset foreground color ( usually black are normal messages . Orange messages are warnings , and red represent errors . Warnings and error messages are linked : a double-clicking on such a message opens the corresponding file in the respective line number
For example , if you compile a file that contains errors , red messages will explain the problems and point to the error location , a double-clicking on such a message opens the file and highlights the line with the error
the terminal window is a terminal st -@ emulator in which you can enter commands as in the GNOME the -@ Terminal .

All settings , including window sizes and positions , will be saved when finishing Anjuta . A session management is still in development , so you should not terminate Anjuta with unsaved documents .

create a new file and pastting text
create a
To create a new file , select FileNew in the menu bar , or click the New File button in the toolbar . A new page will be displayed in the editor ( or a new window if the parent document ? ) . New documents are named New File 1 , New File 2 , New File 3 , etc

You should save new documents as soon as possible to avoid data loss as a result of crashes .
File -@
File creation wizard
the &quot; Open File &quot; dialog .
A wizard can also be used to create a new file . doing do select File New File from the menu bar . The &quot; New File &quot; dialog will open . select the file type and enter the file name . the extension will be added automatically . You can add license information and a file header . In the case of a C / C + header file they can also add a header template . click OK to confirm the creation .
Anjuta occasionally creates new file windows during some operations . For example , some Subversion order -@ operations such as Diff and Log create new file windows and output the outputs there .
insersert macros
You can use macros to quickly edit repetitive text passages .
the macro fil-@ plugin must be activated

there are two types of macros : Anjuta Â -@ macros and users b -@ macros ( they are displayed as &quot; My macros &quot; ) Anjuta -@ macros cannot be changed , but you create and edit users -@ macros
to insert a macro , position the input character to the desired location . Select Edit MacacrosMacros .... A dialog will be opened . Select the desired macro from the list . The result of the macro -@ implementation will be displayed in the window and a summary will be displayed in the dialog . Select Inste .

the macro -
another way to insert macros is to ediEdiInMakacrosmacro ... , and then press the desired macro -@ key combination .
define macro
In the Insert Macro window , Add or select Edit Add MakrosMacro ... , and then the &quot; Add / Edit window , enter the name of the macro , select or define a category , and set a key combination . Then edit text relative to your macro . The character &quot; _ BAR _ &quot; indicates the position of the input character after running the macro . Click click OK . the macro is added to the list .
You can also delete a macro by selecting it in the list and removing it , which of course only possible with user -@ macros ( &quot; My Macros &quot; ) .
Add / edit
Add / edit
Similarly , you can edit and change a macro by selecting it in the list and selecting .
Macro -
They can be included in macro order @ definitions . Makro mac-@ keywords start and end with the sign &quot; @ . &quot;
Keyword -@ Macro .
the keyword -@
Available macro -@ keywords are @ DATE _ TIME @ , @ DATE _ YMD @ , @ DATE _ Y @ , @ USER _ NAME @ , @ FILE _ NAME @ , @ FILE _ NAME _ UP @ , @ FILE _ NAME _ UP _ PREFIX @ , @ EMAIL @ , @ TABSIZE @ , @ INDENTSIZE @ , and @ USETABS @ .
open and
File dialog
open a file : to open an existing file , select File Open from the menu bar , and click the Open button , or use the CtrO gO . this opens the Open File dialog . type enter the name of the file you want to open or select it . then click Open . To open multiple files at once , you can select several one by one by holding Ctrl ; then clicking Open . if you have changed your mind , you can Cancel to close the dialog without opening a file .
Dialog to open multiple files .
the &quot; Open File dialog in multiple file mode
You can enable the Show files setting in the pop-up window , which appears after the right-click in the dialog to opening files . With this setting makes hidden files ( their name starts with . &quot; ) visible in the file list . Take back this setting so not to display hidden files . The dialog for opening files also has a built-in type filter . select the corresponding file type filter in the dialog , and the file list is limited to files of the selected type .
save as a file
Save a file : select to save a file filesSave from the menu bar and click on the Save button in the toolbar , or press Ctrl . if the file is new , the Save As dialog will be opened . Enter a file name and click Save to save the new file under the specified name .
automatic saving of a
If automatic saving is enabled , Anjuta does not automatically save new files . You must first to save them yourself . The same applies to the Save All : Anjuta does not save new files as long as you have not yet saved them yourself .
Save a file under a different name : You can explicitly save a file under a new name . By this select File Save as from the menu bar . The Save File As dialog will be opened and asks you for the new file name .
Overwrite file
If you use Save As with an existing file , the original will not be deleted . It will remain unchanged since the last saving . If a file with the new file name already exists , then a confirmation dialog is displayed to make that you want to overwrite it .
close a file : select to close a file FilesClose from the menu bar , or click the Close button in the toolbar ( you can also close a file by clicking on the cross ( &quot; X &quot; ) in the tab to the file name ) so the current file will be closed . if the file is new or not saved , Anjuta will ask whether the file should saved before closing .

Anjuta has a number of features that will help you edit source files , and the following sections describe how some of the interesting features are used .

the tool bar for
Editor edges : Editor edges are located to the left of the editor and are used for some specific purposes . There are three editor edges available : the line number edge , the marker edge and the border for text folds . By by default ( i.e. at the first start of Anjuta ) , only the edge for text folds .
The border for line numbers is the largest of all three edges ( and slightly darker than the others ) and specithe line numbers of a document . The border for line numbers can be displayed or hidden via the menu item EditorEdge for line numbers . A left click on the border marks an whole line ( including the line break , if available )
The text folding edge may contain the folding tree . A click on nodes in the folding tree folds code # -blocks or blocks . An underscore is displayed under a folline to make fy that a code box -@ block has been folded was folded under the line .
hidden
Editor edges in case of invisible markings edges
if the marking edge is not visible , Anjuta displays markings as the background color of a line . For example , if a marking of a holding point is set for a line and the marking edge is not visible , this line is displayed with a red background . Simil, the background color deep blue or yellow for a bookmark and a line number marking . if you do not like this ( possibly in conjunction with the currently used topic ) , you can turn on the markedge in the VieEditormarkedge .
Machining aids
Editor with editing
Syntax
Anjuta can highlight the syntax of many different languages , which usually done automatically by detecting the file type based on the extension . If Anjuta cannot detect a file type , then no syntax highlighting is used . You can explicitly force an highlighting mode by selecting the style in the VieEditor Highlighting Mode menu .
Anjuta uses a property file called $ prefix / share / anjuta / properties / anjuta.properties , which has the same format as a SciTE -@ property file but does not use all the properties . The style of each element for all languages is stored in the $ prefix / share / anjuta / properties / styles.properties file , using some ordinary properties set by Anjuta in the file $ home / .config / anjuta / Scintilla / editor -@ style.properties file .

Anjuta can display code # -@ folds for source files with languages structured in blocks ( such as C , C + , Pascal , and Java ) . All code -@ blocks in source files can be folded and out by cliclicking on the folding points in the edge for code -@ folding of the editor -@ window ( usually a &quot; + / - &quot; icon or an arrow up / down ) .
Code rt-@ folding is particularly useful when editing very large source files with thousands of rows . Once once parts are ded
Please note that code ar -@ folding and editing tools are only available in Scintilla bei-@ Editor
automatic formatting of source
Anjuta can automatically format C or C + source files or headers ader -@ files automatically move in ) . This allows a good overview of the source code , improves readability , reduces the likelihood of syntax errors and especially saves time . For automatic backdent select EditAutomatic indent in the menu bar .
You can browse C and C + source files and header files in the files in the files . a tag ( or icon ) refers to a named entity such as a function definition , structure , or macro . Anjuta searches open C -@ and C + source files and headers -@ files for existing tags
Symbol -
Anjuta automatically searches for tags in all source and headers of -@ files of an open project . You can jump to any function definition , structure definition , class definition or other tags without opening the corresponding file before . You don &apos;t have to know in which file the tag was found . the dialog -@ Browser lists all symbols in the project
Tag at -@
You do not have to worry about the matching and updating the tag -@ database . Anjuta takes over all this .
search and replace text in files

to search for a string or a regular expression in the current file , select Edit ditFind or press Ctrl AltF , and the Find dialog will open .
Enter the string you be for in the field and select whether it is a normal string or a regular expression . You can also set the search direction , cassensitive , and the search area .
in successful search , Anjuta jumps to the search hit or performs another action ( according to the search you selected in the Search Desttab ) .
If you want to continue the search , click the Search button again or press Ctrl . , so the next search will is visited ( Use Shift Ctrl for the previous search hit ) . You can change the search text by typing the new string in the Search Print text box in the search dialog .

Find and Replace is comparable to the text search , with the difference that you can also enter the text in the Replace Replace with , and you can also specify whether you want to be asked before each replacement ( &quot; Replace first hit &quot; and &quot; replace all hits &quot; ) .
Select Replace to replace the match or Next to reach the next match

You can also save search options .
