I would prefer nothing . but the red is not intended for me .

my father created Voltron , but Zarkon is a better leader in the battle , so he became Voltron &apos;s right hand .
Lance , when you accepted Keith as Voltr&apos;s new leader , it showed that a strong team is more important to you than your urge for fame .

I don not disappoint him .

I know we have difficulties , but Lotor must not escape us .
Acxa . set course on the coordinates .
I will lure the lions there .
to the Thayser

these are not the paladins who defeated

How do you know ?
They do not fight as a unit and cannot form Voltron
my father probably dealt as much damage to the team as they did to him .
However , they are vulnerable , and we must take advantage of
we recalibrate your hunter for the atmosphere on Thayserix .

what happens on Thayserix
the planet consists of dense gases and has magnetic poles that affect normal sensors .
when the lions are there , they are blind .
nothing for unut , Narti .

I scare away the lions , and you grab them

we don &apos;t follow him , because what awaits us
People , we have a problem
my sensors play crazy .
probably because of the atmosphere and the magnet -@ Poland of the planet .
we have no time for that .
he must not escape .
without the sensors and equipment , we do not recognize where there is up and below or how we get out .
-we should go back . -No !

-Lotor has probably called reinforcement .

we must form Voltron .
but last time we could not form Voltron .
we have to try .
maybe we were too divided and unorganized , we only come out here when we work together
we are a team
Shiro believed in us .
we must believe in ourselves .
do you think ?
-Yes ! -so then ...
Voltron
I recognize an unknown energy -@
-Hunk , I &apos;m one leg .
-Pretty cool , isn &apos;t it ?
Lotor escapes .
shall we fly after him ?

we brought ourselves into this situation through false ambition .
we must be ready for him .
understood , team leader .
where do we fly
Voltron is there at the back .
we have to fight now !
a leader knows when to leave the battlefield .
we determine when we face them .
You can form Voltron again .
is this a

-What is
-Yes , we do not know this alarm .

what if that is a
this is an Old Tean ship , and we fly there .

according to the identification code , the traling is fleet cruiser .

this is not a normal wormhole
it generates huge amounts of energy , where the ship is stuck .

They need

the energy is neither radioactive nor thermal .
It also produces no gravity . and the light shines out , unlike black holes .

this is quintessence !
not
ok , do we stay away from the thing , yes
does not .
have you not seen that ?
Voltron is much more stable than anything else in the universe .
we received an Old Tean emergency signal , so there is on the ship .
as paladine of Voltron we have to help .
but I still believe that this could be a trap
and it is too dangerous to fly in anyway .
I fly alone when I have to
ok , very slow .
Pidge , can you explain this to us ?
the Euclidean space around the ship is an anomaly .
but the energy does not come from a source that fits into our reality .
that was probably a no .
I scan for biorhythms .
strange , I do not receive signs of life .
maybe not here , but the ship is
-we must go through .
-by the glowing Inferno ?
Pidge , keep an eye on Voltr&apos;s functions .
we stop immediately when it becomes
understood , then we break off immediately .
People , my sensors play crazy
we should explode just like the drone .
but somehow the room space curvature does not affect Voltron .

what can you see
the connection breaks off .


we must be through . that is the nose of the

the rear part of the ship is gone .
Coran ! Coran

how can that be ?
you put down the Galra , -@ uprising . You founded our empire . 10,000 years ago .
where we come here Zarkon destroyed your planet and wiped out the Alteans .
where do you come from ?

your theory about Voltron has been confirmed .
I had hoped to experience a bigger fire
all previous recovery , -@ attempts , were more entertaining .
Well , not for your pilots .
Voltron came through because he is made of the same material as the meteorite that King Alfor wanted to hide from father .
let &apos;s see if the new paladine bring him to us .
and when Voltron is trapped in the other

can you take a sample ?
I try

that is Voltron .

it is of course not really Voltron , but the energy waves are the ones Zarkon was looking for
and those who led us to the blue lion .
so you could enter this reality .
Your vehicle consists of the same transreal material
that is why Voltron is so powerful .
with this material , Altea can build its own transreal ships .

General Hira , I have discovered something on the ship that ensures Altea &apos;s rule over millennia .
the Alteans of this reality have defeated the Galra ?
under your leadership , Empress .
if you not had fought and reengge avvenfather , Altea could never have provided peace throughout the universe
that is the last .
do you think the plan works ?
don &apos;t worry .
I am 60 % sure , this is one of the 0.15 % realities in which this plan works 100 % .
whether people from the other reality help the Old teans
are they really my friends , it is 72 % likely that they decide
first we had to beat Zarkon . since then we have brought all worlds the true peace of Altea .

but you have to help us with one thing .

I suspessed that forces of the Gamara were on board .
but not that Empress Allura &apos;s friends help
Altea again .
it seemed an unrealizable dream that I never dared to dream .
Allura , that &apos;s not the altea you knew
that is true .
this altea has prevented the Galra from spreading throughout the universe , as with you .
Empress , we will do everything to help you .
the meteorite on this ship can travel between the realities .
you activactivate this ship , we can free the ship and the meteorites from the crack .
then we fly into your universe and bring you peace . even the Galra .
thinks well about it , Allura .
even recently we thought all Galra was evil
maybe it is not as easy as she does .
Keith , that is my people . this would be the strongest alliance we have .

did he teleported ?
maybe he wanted to help you
by providing me with the Galra ?
maybe Zarkon has manipulated him .

yes , maybe .
So , as soon as you feel up , the others are certainly happy to see you

we are now six paladins , but we have only five lions , that is , we are a paladin too much .
you are right .
Shiro takes over the black , you want your red

It could achieve unimagined things .
that is true .
so I would do the team a favor if I say goodbye .

why is Voltron made of the same material as the meteorite ?
what is so special about it ?
Father discovered a meteorite before my birth
Your father . and Zarkon .
when Zarkon was paladin of the black lion ?
even before .
before Alfor built the lions .
it hurts to talk about it , but since we want to stop lotor , we have to hear the rest .
In the beginning , the paladins were five great leaders , although they came from cultures that were very different and were been war for generations , they attached their differences to protect their common interests .
which was rather a alliance in the beginning developed into a friendship
a warriwar alliance had emerged , and they kept away those who would harm them .
Oje .
I warn you of solo alone , Alfor .
as an alchemist you are much wister than a soldier
for that I have you , Zarkon .
the original paladins were Zarkon of Daibazaal ,
King Alfor of Altea , Gyrgan of Rygnirath ,
Trigel vom Dalterion , -@ belt and Blaytz by Nalquoud

a little less discipline would do you good , Zarkon .
I remember when Lambonit around -@ Plunderers .

-the gang had you under control .
why do I just engage with these crooks ?
because we are the only crooks on your side .

Rygnirath
They did not suspect that after this night the universe would be another forever .
we evacuated all Galra , -@ inhabitants at the crater .
-What did you find
-I don &apos;t
this meteorite is different from the others .
-A material changes the realities .
-What do you mean
Scholars have always had the theory that several realities exist .
whole other universes with stories that we know nothing about .
but you could never prove it .
until far , because when we moved the meteorite we discovered this here
that is another reality ?

Alfor , they are fantastic .
how do they

the alloy with a meteorite ? -@ ore makes it almost indestructible .
what armament do they have ?
now it gets really interesting
Old tean alchemy can create great triats .

it communicated with me .

Alfort &apos;s compassion for his comrade made him blind to Zarkon &apos;s true plans .
according to Honerva , we can only close the transition with the power of quint

Zarkon &apos;s attempt to save Honerva was in vain .
both succumbed to the radiation overload of the quintessence .
Zarkon had deceived the palad
They had enlarged the transition , which DaibazDaibazaal .
King Alfor was forced to evacuate the planet .

King Alfor of Altea destroyed our planet .
he will pay expensive for his crimes .

the revenge will be ours !
Zarkon became evil par excellence , obsessed with quintessence .
for a new opening between the realities he needed Voltron .
and so the war
the Galra followed her leader immediately and
the planets were not prepared for
soon they were all defeated . except for Altea
so as not to drop Voltron into Zarkon &apos;s hands , the lions were sent to distant corners
Zarkon raced with anger .
he killed King Alfor . he atoned for the loss of Daibazaal with the destruction of Altea .
so that is Lotor &apos;s plan .
into other universes . -to get the purest quintessence .
-no matter how . we have to stop him .

some kids are assholes , Sam .
that &apos;s just .
but even the assholes get girlfriends .
everyone do themselves easily , only I don not .
that is not true .
Believe me it &apos;s hard for everyone .
not for you
you stretched Mom the guy with the jeep .
I presented that too simple .
when your mom had got rid of the idiot , she let me flash ten times . okay ?
that &apos;s how it works .
but one must not give up
so could I get a girl to like me ?
of course .
then I need strawberries coated with chocolate .
Hey , Mr. Freigeist .

before I do something , want to know all the
your boyfriend ?
which teenagers live together ?
Julia is not a teenager .
It is 26 years and three quarters .
Julia , your therapist ?
let us disappear .
come out .
we drive .
Well .
in the animal kingdom , attraction is a simple , biological
we have to go away .
only people make it complicated .
Wow , this is a great garden .
you could set up a pool .
Adjustable pools are cheap .
you can build a terrace around , then it is almost like a real pool .
that &apos;s all I have to say about pools .
but ... Do you want to say something
okay .
why did you flew from school

that &apos;s you . everyone tells something else .
What did you do ?

-
I have enough trouble , and with you I could get
- Why don &apos;t you tell me ?
- It is stupid .
- Okay , go home
- Come
I stolen a tuba .

I stolen a tuba .
and a trumpet .
and then a few saxophones .
I broke into the rehearsal room and had a few instruments
I wanted to move them . I
I had no good reason .
the rehearsal room was not
that was the reason .
however , no matter .
90 minutes later , the cops were with me and handcued me .
and since I have stolen the stuff out of my own school , I flew out .
that &apos;s it .
that was . I hope you are satisfied .
is that your seriousness ?
you were stolen musical instruments
- You you done
- I said yes , it is stupid . I
- Why do you laugh ?
- Because that is for shooting .
because everyone think you are a blatant edevil .
- How did you dragged them away ?
- With my hand
that is getting better and better .
I don &apos;t know that you laugh me out .
I should not have said
- I have to pick up my sister .
- I didn &apos;t
- Evan ,
-
I know .
I should
this is really unfavorable timing , but I ...
Yes , you should .

-
the arrow was pointed and sharp .
one should think that there are regulations that prohibit something in public .
they are generally dangerous , are they ?

with you , alcoholized people fire weapons through the area .
that &apos;s dangerous , isn &apos;t it ?
-
- I don &apos;t arrive ... - What ?
- Well , your top is in the way .
of course .
then go .
okay .
I make wound ointment
that has expired .
so what will not be bad
yes , they only have so much space on these small tubes that they print indiscriminately superfluous information .
I never met you like you
and that
you can dress
we should exchange numbers .
if side effects occur from the expired ointment .
Listen you should forget the matter with

on the one hand it is much older than you .
and when you tell her what you feel , it is a conflict of interest , she can no longer be your therapist
- But I need them as a therap
then look for someone at your age .
a kind of practice friend before I Julia date .
so I wouldn not call that
before Roald Amundsen crossed the Antarctic , he did practice tours in simpler terrain .
that is only
if I have enough experience with other girls , Julia becomes my girlfriend and is no longer my therapist .
or you could find a girl of your age .
that would be ideal for
and these girls will like you .
this is a good advice , thank you
at any time .
Hey , Dad , will you tell Mom that with Julia ?
- Do you want that ?
- No , thank you .
good , then that remains among us .
I don &apos;t want to specify , but I had a really good day with Sam .
he is a good boy .
- What happened to your
- Nothing . That was a nail in the
show him me , then I beat him
- Have you done something on it ?
- Yes , wound oint
It had expired , but ...
the stuff does not really work .
it only loses effect .
what is it
because I &apos;m such a good
- Yes , you are Superdad .
- Yes ? - Can I get a cape
- Not now .
make the light .
human behavior is less to that of a chicken than that of an albatros .
