5.2 Pharmacokinetics
Experimental animals and dogs absorb orally administered mitratapid quickly .
the most important metabolic conversion is sulfoxidation , which produces three active metabolites .

Mitratapide and its metabolites bind to a large extent ( &gt; 99 % ) to plasma proteins and are distributed in the tissues .
the brain is not affected , which is why a central effect of the veterinary medicinal product can be ruled out .
the excretion takes place quickly and predominantly via the feces .
8.5 hours ; the sulphone metabolite reaches 0.0092 µg / ml after 17.5 hours .
at the end of a three-week treatment period , Mitratapid reaches average steady nor-@ state fil-@ concentrations of 0.0068 µg / ml , the sulfoxide fil-@ metabolites of 0.0089 µg / ml , respectively
the terminal plasma half-life time is 6.3 hours for mitratapid , 9.8 hours or

Summary of the EPAR for the public
this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) , which explains how the Committee on Medicinal inary Medicinal Products ( CVMP ) has reached the recommendations on the application of veterinary inal on the on the assessment of the documents submitted .
this document cannot replace the personal conversation with the veterinarian .

If you would like more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Zactr
Zactran is an injection solution for cattle containing the active ingredient gamithromycin ( 150 mg / ml ) .
WHW is Zactran used ?
Zactran is an antibio
it is used to treat and prevent respatory diseases ( Bovine Respiratory Dis) caused by the bacteria Mannheimia haemytica , Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni
before the use of Zactran to prevent Germany of Germany , the occurrence of the disease in the herd should have been detected .
Zactran is administered as a unique subcutaneous injection ( injected under the skin ) .
the dose to be applied is calculated based on the weight of the animal to be treated .
Animals with a weight of over 250 kg must be administer the injection at more than one place .
how does Zactran
the active ingredient of Zactran , gamithromycin , is an antibiotic from the group of macrolides .
it works by blockcking the bacterial ribosomes , i.e. the parts of the cells in which proteins are produced , and thus inhibits the growth of the bacteria .
how was Zactran
suitable studies have been carried out to the efficacy of zactran in cattle .
the main clinical studies were carried out on farms in a number of countries in Europe and outside the EU .
the effect of Zactran on the treatment of FRG has been investigated compared to another EU-approved macrorolid de -@ antibiotic ( Tulathromycin ) on already ill cattle .
the effect of Zactran on the prevention of Germany was investigated compared to a placebo ( sham drug ) on cattle in the same farm

what benefits has Zactran shown in these studies
it has been proven that Zactran was effective in the treatment and prevention of caused by Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni .
for the treatment of FRG , Zactran has to be as effective as Tulathromycin .
what risk is associated with Zactran ?
After the injection of Zactran , a swelling at the injection site occurs in up to 45 % of the animals .
the animals may also show signs of mild pain for a day .
the swelling generally regses within 3 to 14 days , but can persist in some animals up to 35 days after treatment .
what precautions must be taken by persons who administer the medicinal product or come into contact with the animal ?
Persons with known hypersensitivity ( allergy ) to similar antibiotics ( from the group of macrolides ) should avoid contact with Zactran .
Zactran can cause irritation of the eyes or skin .
therefore , contact with skin or eyes should be avoided .
if Zactran comes into direct contact with the eyes if they be immediately rinsed out with clear water .
in case of direct skin contact , the affected area should also be washed off immediately with clear water .
in the event of accidental self-injection , a doctor should be consulimmediately and the package leaflet or label shown to him .
how long must be waited until the laughter of the animal and with the consumption of the flesh by man ( waiting time ) ?
the animals may only be slaughtered 64 days after the last administration of Zactran .
how long must it be maintained until the milk of the animal can be used for human consumption ?
since the safety of Zactran in breeding animals has not breeding animals , the drug must not be used in lactating cows or heifers whose milk is intended for human consumption .
it must also not be used for pregnant cows or heifers , whose milk is intended for human consumption , in the last two months before the date of birth .
Why was Zactran
the Committee on Medicinal Products VeterUse ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Zactran in the therapeutic and preventive treatment of respiratory diseases in cattle ( Germany ) caused by Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni ( if the occurrence of the disease in the herd ) outweigh the risks , and recommended granthe isation on the market of Zactran .

5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Gamithromycin is an azalide from the group of semi-ynthetic macrolidantibiotics , consisting of a 15 itu-@ C lactone ring with a characteristic alkylated nitrogen atom at position 7A
this special chemical structure allows the rapid absorption at physiological pH fil-@ value and the long duration of action in the target tissue lungs .
Macrolide antibiotics have both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects , as they interrupt bacterial protein synthesis by bying to the ribosomal 50S -@ subunit and thus preventing the extension of the peptide chain .

what is Zubrin
Zubrin is a lyophilisate for taking , i.e. a kind of tablet that quickly decays after contact with moisture , e.g. when placed on the dog &apos;s tongue .
Zubrin contains the effective ingredient tepoxal
WHW is Zubrin used ?
Zubrin is used in dogs against inflammation and pain relief in acute and chronic diseases of the musculoskeletal system
Zubrin is administered to the dog a day about 1 -@ 2 hours feeding until the animal is better again .
However , as side effects may occur , any treatment should be carried out over more than 1 - 2 weeks under regular veterinary control .
how does Zubrin
Zubrin contains tepoxaline , which belongs to the drug class of so-called non-steroidal antiphlogistics ( NSAID ) .
Zubrin works by blocking the enzymes Cyclooxygenase fil-@ 1 and Cyclooxygenase -@ 2
when these enzymes are blocked , less prostaglandin is
since the prostaglandins are substances that cause inflammation , tepoxalin reduces the inflammation and swelling of muscles or joints and the associated pain .

5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
tepoxalin is a double cyclooxygenase and 5 fil-@ lipoxygenase fil-@ inhibitor with anti-inflammatory effect .
the oral administration of 10 mg tepoxaline / kg body weight leads to an inhibition of prostaglandin and leukotria as -@ synthesis .
5.2 Pharmacokinetics
2 hours ) .
After administration of a therapeutic dose of 10 mg / kg , the Cmax of tepoxalin fed dogs was 1.08 ± 0.37 µg / ml ( low-fat feed ) and 1.19 ± 0.29 µg / ml ( fat feed ) .
the absorption of tepoxalin is favoured by administration to fed dogs .
tepoxalin is significantly converted into its acid metabolites .
the acid metabolite is a highly effective cyclooxygenase fil-@ inhibitor and prolongs the efficacy of the parent substance .
in the dog , the plasma concentrations of the acid metabolite are higher than those of the parent substance .
after several administration over a wide dose range , no accumulation of tepoxalin or its acid metabolite was detected .
tepoxaline and its metabolites are highly bound , i.e. over 98 % bound to proteins .
tepoxalin and its metabolites are excreted via the faeces ( 99 % ) .
