3 . Normal value
3.1 Determination of the normal value for all executing manufacturers without MWB .
a ) Comparative
35 ) suto Article 2 ( 7 of the Basic Regulation , the normal value in the case of imports from countries without a market economy and if companies cannot be granted , be determined from countries referred to in Article 2 ( 7 ( b of the General Ordinance on the basis of the price or the mathematically determined value in a country ative comparison .
( 36 ) In the announcement of the opening of the proceedings , the Commission proposed Turkey as an appropriate comparative country to determine the normal value for the People &apos;s Republic of China and invited the interested parties to comment on opinion .
( 37 ) Some interested parties objected to this proposal .
the most important arguments they made against Turkey were :
- a lack of competition in the Turkish domestic market ( there are only three manufacturers in Turkey ) ;
- production in Turkey represents 1.3 % of Chinese production
- the cost structure of Chinese manufacturers differs from those that the Turkish manufacturers , particularly in terms labour and raw materials ;
- the economic and cultural relations of the People of Republic of China and those of Turkey with EU differ because Turkey is closer to Europe , has benefiting a customs union with the since 1995 and milating its legislation in the light of Turkey &apos;s negotiations on Turkey &apos;s accession to the EU to the EU nor-@ Standards ;
- the Turkish currency lost much in value ; some Turkish manufacturers are associated with applicants
- the quality of the Turkish goods is too
( 38 ) The interested parties proposed India or Russia as suitable comparative countries .
( 39 ) The Commission sought to work from other potential comparison countries such as Russia , India , Japan , South Korea , the United States , Serbia and Montenegro and South Africa
of the 38 companies around the world with whom she acted , only two companies in the US agreed to
( 40 ) The analysis of the available information revealed that there is competition on the US -@ American market for the goods with at least three manufacturers , around 30 suppliers , more than 15 introducporters and around 300 users .
According to the investigation results , as mentioned under Recital 14 , the goods concerned and the stones manufactured in the People Republic of China or the USA and sold on the domestic markets and the domestic markets were the similar .
Furthermore , the investigation found that more than 50 % of the raw materials used by one of the US -@ American manufacturers were imported from the People &apos;s Republic of China , and that the manufacturing processes in the two countries did not differ significantly .
( 41 ) It shall provisionally concluded that the United States of America was the most appropriate and acceptable comparative country within the meaning of Article 2 ( 7 ) of the Basic Regulation .
b ) Determination of the
( 42 ) In accordance with Article 2 ( 7 ) ( a ) of the General Ordinance , the normal value for those implementing manufacturers to whom no MB has been granted was determined on the basis of the verified information by the manufacturer in the country ative country .
Since the sales of the US C--@ American manufacturers according to the results were transactions in normal trade , the normal value for the types of goods comparable to the types of goods ported out from the People of Republic of China was determined on the basis the prices paid or be paid on the US -@ American domestic market .
( 43 ) The normal value was the weighed average domestic selling price that the cooperating US -@ American manufacturers charged independent customers for types of goods with comparable MgO -@ salary .
if necessary , corrections were made for the different treatments of the different types of goods .
3.2 Determination of the normal value for the executive manufacturers to whom an MWB was granted
( 44 ) It should be recalled that the dumping range for the companies to which an MWB was determined on the basis of their information on domestic sales and the production costs for the goods concerned .
this data has been checked in the companies of the companies concerned .
( 45 ) In order to determine the normal value , the Commission first examined for each cooperating executive manufacturer whether the total domestic sales of the goods concerned were representative compared to the total export sales to the Community .
in accordance with Article 2 ( 2 ) of the General Regulation , domestic sales were considered representative if the total quantity of these sales of each executive manufacturer corresponds to at least 5 % of the total amount of manufacturer &apos;s export sales to the Community .
( 46 ) On this basis , it was found that the domestic sales of the affected goods representative of an executive manufacturer in the UZ
the domestic sales of the affected goods of the other executive manufacturer in the UZ were not representative .
( 47 ) For the executive manufacturer with representative domestic sales , the Commission then determined the product types sold on the domestic market , which identical or directly comparable to types sold for export to the Community .
( 48 ) For each type sold on the domestic market , which , according to the results was directly comparable to a type sold for export to the Community , it was examined whether the domestic sales were sufficiently representative within the meaning of Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Basic Ordinance .
the domestic sales of a particular type of goods were considered sufficiently representative if the total volume of the domestic sales of this type in the UZ was 5 % or more of the total volume of the export sales of the comparable product type into the Community .
( 49 ) This analysis revealed that the executive manufacturer with total representative sales did not sell all types of goods in representative quantities .
( 50 ) The Commission then examined whether the domestic sales of the individual types of sold in representative quantities on the domestic market could be regarded as transactions in normal trade , for which the share of profitable sales to independent customers was determined .
( 51 ) Domestic sales were considered profitable if the unit price of the respective type of goods was at least to the production costs .
therefore , the production costs were determined for each product sold in the UZ on the domestic market .
( 52 ) As mentioned under recitals 50 and 51 , the share of profitable sales of the type of goods in question to independent customers on the domestic market was determined .
in cases where the sales quantity of a type sold at a net selling price in the amount of the mathematicalculated production costs or above was 80 % or more to the total sales quantity of that type and in which the weighaverage price of the type in question was at least the production costs , the normal was based on the actual domestic price , which determined as a weighed average the prices of all domestic sales made in the UZ , of whether these sales were profitable or not .
in cases where the volume of profitable sales of a type accounted for less than 80 % of the total sales volume of the type in question or where the weighed average price of the type in question was below production costs , the normal was based on the actual domestic price , which was determined as a weighaverage of only profitable sales , provided the volume of these sales made for 10 % or more the total sales volume of the type in question .
( 53 ) If the profitable sales of a type were less than 10 % of the total sales volume , it was considered that the sales volumes of this type were not sufficient to use the domestic price as an appropriate basis for determining the normal value
( 54 ) The above analysis showed that certain types of goods were sold in normal
( 55 ) For all types of goods that were either not sold in representative quantities or - due to the invoiced prices - not sold in normal trade ( csee Recitons 52 and 53 ) , the domestic prices of the manufacturer in question could not be used to determine the normal value , so that another different method had to be applied .
( 56 ) In cases where the domestic prices of a certain type sold by an executive manufacturer could not be used , the normal value had to be calculated on the basis of the costs of the manufacturer in question .
the normal value was calculated in accordance with Article 2 ( 3 ) of the Basic Ordinance by adding an appropriate amount for the sales , administrative and heads costs , if where necessary of the executed out for the sales , administrative and overheads ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; VG -@ Kosten &quot; ) and an appropriate profit margin .
to this end , the Commission examined whether the VG -@ costs and the profits recorded by the company were reliable .
( 57 ) The VG -@ costs were considered reliable if the total volume of domestic sales of the company concerned could be considered representative compared to volume of export sales to the Community .
the domestic profit margin was determined on the basis of domestic sales of the types sold in normal trading .
this was done on the basis of the method set out under recital of 45 , 48 , 52 and 53 .
for a company , the actually recorded VG -@ costs and profits could be used because it met the aforementioned criteria
( 58 ) For the other company whose domestic sales were not representative , the normal value was determined pursuant to Article 2 ( 6 ) ( c ) of the General Ordinance .
According to the investigation results , the cost structure of the other company with MWB and representative domestic sales for only a types of goods showed such deviations that it was not a reasonable basis for determining the normal value .
However , the costs of the company , whose domestic sales were not representative , were reliable according to the investigation results , so that the normal value was determined on the basis the data of the company corresponded to of the other exporters / manufacturers of the same goods in that country of origin .
4 .
( 59 ) All export sales to the community of exectors with MWB or IT were handled either through related importers in the community , associated importers outside the community or through companies that were not associated with the executive manufacturers but worked closely with them or even had the exclusive distribution right .
in cases where exports via affiliated companies were sold , the export prices were calculated in accordance Article 2 , paragraph 9 of the Basic Regulation .
in all cases where the exports of the goods concerned went to independent customers in the Community , the export price was calculated in accordance with Article 2 ( 8 ) of the General Regulation on the basis of the export prices actually paid or paid to be paid .
60 ) In accordance with Article 2 ( 9 ) of the General Regulation , corrections were made for all costs incurred by the importer between import and resale , including the VG -@ costs and an reasonable profit margin .
in this case , the profit margin actually recorded by the cooperating independent introducporters was regarded as a justifiable basis .
5 .
( 61 ) The normal value and export prices were compared at the ex level and at the same trading level
in the interest of a fair settlement , pursuant to Article 2 ( 10 of the General Regulation , corrections for differences were made on request , which demonstrably influenced the prices and comparability of prices .
( 62 ) These corrections concerned differences in transport , insurance , deployment , loading and ancillary costs , borrowing costs , commissions , import duties and customer service costs ( guarantee )
6 . Dumping
6.1 Cooperating executive manufacturers who have been granted an MWB / IB
( 63 ) In the case of the two companies to which a MB has been granted , pursuant to Article 2 ( paragraph 11 of the Basic OrdRegulation , the weighaverage normal value of the individual types of the goods carried ported into the Community was compared to the weighed average export price of the corresponding type .
64 . In the case of the four companies to which an IB was granted , pursuant to Article 2 ( paragraph 11 of the General Regulation ance , the weighed average normal value of the individual types of the goods carried out into the Community was compared with the weighed average export price of the corresponding type .
( 65 ) The preliminary weighative average dumping ranges , expressed as a percentage of cif -@ prices free Community limit , unpaid , reach the values :
- Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 11,2 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 34,1 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Guangyang Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 55.7 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Kyushu Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 55.7 % _ BAR _
- Dashiqiao Sanqiang Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 99,9 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Qinghua Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 41.4 % . _ BAR _
6.2 For all other
( 66 ) To calculate the dumping range for all other exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China , the Commission initially determined the scope of cooperation .
To this compared the total imports of the goods concerned by Eurostat -@ statistics according the method out under the ital referred out under recital 81 originating in the People of Republic of China with to the answers ses the cooperating exporters in the People Republic of China to the questionaire
after that the cooperation was small .
( 67 ) In view of the low cooperation , the dumping range was set for all exporters in the People Republic of China in the amount of the highest dumping range determined for the cooperating manufacturers , namely 99.9 % of the cif -@ price free Community limit , unpaid .
However , according to the assresults , the nationwide dumping range was higher than the residual damage margin .
C. SCHÄDIGUNG
1 .
( 68 ) In this study it was found that Magnesia -@ stones were produced by :
- two applicant Community manufacturers and two other manufacturers who worked fully with the Commission during the investigation ( RHI , LWB , Refractarios Burceña S.L. and Ceramica del Nalon S.A. ) ;
- a manufacturer who answered the questionnaire in detail , but spoke out against the procedure ( refrattechnique ) ;
- seven other manufacturers and well opiatrelels ( the Italian Association of FiFiretory -@ Industry , which represents a production of 64000 tonnes ) , which supported the industry of the Community , but did not answer the questionnaire in detail .
another manufacturer sent a letter , but expressed neither agreagreement nor negative .
2 . Definition of the
2.1 Manufacturers or manufacturers associated with the People &apos;s Republic of China who introduce the affected goods from the People Republic of China
( 69 ) The investigation revealed that two of the cooperating manufacturers in the Community , RHI and Refratechnik , also introduced the affected goods from the People &apos;s Republic of China
For this reason , it was been examined whether these companies should be excluded from the Community industry in accordance with Article 4 ( 1 ( a ) of the General Regulation .
2.1.1 RHI
( 70 ) RHI produces in the Community , but also introduces the goods from a affilijoint Joint -@ Venture -@ company in the People &apos;s Republic of China of China , RHI Liaoning .
It was found that in the UZ , most of the Community sales of RHI were produced in the Community and that only a small proportion came from the People &apos;s Republic of China of China .
this share is low , because the Chinese production of RHI is primarily intended for the rapidly growing Asian market
RHI is also the largest manufacturer in the Community , and its headquarters , the R &amp; D -@ Centre and the largest production facilities are located in the Community
For this reason , it was found that the core business of RHI is located in the Community is located in the goods .
( 71 ) Subsequently , it was examined the impact of the sale of the imported goods had on the total sales of the company in the Community .
the investigation found that RHI had no significant profitability benefits from the resale of imports .
this resulted in a comparison of the profitability of the cooperating Community manufacturers .
( 72 ) Given the low share of imports and the fact that these imports had no significant positive impact on the profitability of Community sales as a whole , this company was not immune from the negative effects of harmful dumping .
for this reason , it considers that it would not be justified to exclude RHI from the Community sector
2.1.2 Ref
( 73 ) Refratechnik also produces the affected goods in the community and introduces them from manufacturers in the People &apos;s Republic of China
the investigation found that almost half of the company &apos;s joint sales were in the UZ in the People &apos;s Republic of China of China .
It was also noted that the expansion of business was largely made possible by increasing imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China of China .
For this reason , the view was held that the core business of refratechnik is not only in the community , but also in the People &apos;s Republic of China of China .
( 74 ) It was then examined how the sales introduced affected the Company &apos;s total sales in the Community .
the investigation revealed that in contrast to HI , Refratechnik had a significant benefit from the resale of imports .
( 75 ) In view of the high proportion of imports in the total amount of sales in the Community and the fact that the core business seems to be gradually transferred to the People &apos;s Republic of China and that Refratechnik clearly had a benefit from dumped imports , it was held that Refratechnik should be excluded from the Community sector in accordance with Article 4 ( 1 ( a ) of the General Regulation and is to be regarded as &apos; other market participants &apos; .
2.2 Community
76 ) The production of the four Community manufacturers who worked fully in the investigation , including RHI and without refrate technology , amounted to 233732 tonnes in the investigation period , which corresponds to 53 % of the total Community production , thus which these companies will form the Community the Community within the meaning of Article 4 ( 1 ) and 5 ( 4 ) of the General Regulation .
( 77 ) The study did not show any own consumption of the goods for the Magnesia -@ Steine producing industry .
some steel companies , on the other hand , Magnesia -@ stones for self-
however , this quantity was low compared to the production volumes of the refractory -@ industry in the community .
since this production is intended for self-consumption in the steel industry and none of the companies in the steel industry worked as a manufacturer of Magnesia -@ stones ( although many of them received questionnaires ) , this part of the seems not to have no significant impact on the Community industry .
( 78 ) As the Community industry consisted of four companies and two of these companies accounted for around 2 % of the production volume , the following information for the Community industry was indexed for confidentiality .
3 .
( 79 ) Consumption was determined on the of estimates of the industry provided by the Community industry according to usual practice .
the calculation of this data was based the basis of steel production ( source : relevant reports from the International Iron and Steel Institute - IISI ) , divided by the average amount of the goods required for the production of a ton of steel .
( 80 ) The import quantities were determined based on the Eurostat reli-@ data for the relevant KN fil-@ codes ( 68159100 , 68159910 , 68151010 , 68159990 , 69021000 and 69039020 ) .
of the quantities , deductions were made for those goods which were clearly not the goods concerned in view of their price .
the net quantities resulting after duction ( for 7together 73291 tonnes and 59831 tonnes for the People Republic of China ) were compared with the import volumes specified by the cooperating manufacturers in the PRRepublic of China ( around 42000 tonnes ) .
Given the fact that i introduced around 13500 tonnes from other countries other than the People of the Republic of China , ii according to the importers and users in the Community , the goods were also introduced by non-cooperating exectors in the People Republic of China , and iii many other exuting manufacturers in the People of Republic of China , but did not cooperate , it was held that the Eurostat -@ statistics correctly record the import volumes correctly .
In addition , China Metallurgical News , 4 , 2004 , 2004 reported that 8000 tonnes were exported to Europe in 2003 , which ating that the aforementioned Eurostat -@ number is not too high for the UZ ( 59831 ) .
( 81 ) The sales of the Community industry on the Community market were determined on the basis of the verified responses by the five cooperating Community manufacturers ( including refrate technology ) to the questionnaire .
the remaining quantities ( i.e. consumption less imports less sales of the Community industry ) were seen as sales of the non-cooperating Community manufacturers
( 82 ) The consumption determined in this , whose development is shown in the following table , shows that the demand for the goods concerned in the Community was practically constant in the reference period
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Community consumption _ BAR _ 399563 _ BAR _ 397203 _ BAR _ 401499 _ BAR _ 400638 _ BAR _

4 . Imports from the country concerned to the Community .
4.1 Market share of imports
( 83 ) The quantities and market share of imports from the country concerned developed as follows :
Import quantities _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR
VR China _ BAR _ 23980 _ BAR _ 44542 _ BAR _ 54181 _ BAR _ 59831 _ B
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 186 _ BAR _ 226 _ BAR _ 250 _ BAR _
Market share of imports _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
VR China _ BAR _ 6,0 % _ BAR _ 11,2 % _ BAR _ 13,5 % _ BAR _ 14,9 % _ B
( 84 ) While the consumption of Magnesia -@ stones remained constant during the reference period , the imports from the country concerned increased by around 150 % in the same period .
the market share of the People &apos;s Republic of China increased from 6.0 % to 14.9 % to more in the reference period .
4.2 Prices of imports and

Prices of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China ( Source : Eurostat ) _ BAR _ 686 _ BAR _ 601 _ BAR _ 560 _ BAR _ 533 _ BAR
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 88 _ BAR _ 82 _ BAR _ 78 _ BAR _
( 85 ) The above table shows the development of the average prices of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
in the reference period , prices fell by 22 %
( 86 ) The prices charged by the Community industry and the manufacturers in the country concerned in the UZ on the Community market were compared .
the prices were compared after deduction of all discounts and volume discounts
the prices of the Community industry were brought put to the factory works , and as import prices , the cif -@ prices free the Community border were based .
( 87 ) The comparison showed that the imports of the goods concerned were sold in the UZ in the Community at prices that were 16.6 % below the prices of the Community industry ( expressed as a percentage of the prices of the Community sector ) .
In view of this price undercut range and the development of the prices of the Community sector , it is clear that prices have already been pushed considerably .
5 . Situation of the Community
( 88 ) According to Article 3 ( 5 ) of the Basic Regulation , the examination of the impact of dumped imports on the Community sector included an assessment of all economic factors and indices that influenced the situation of the Community industry from 2001 ( base year ) to the U.
( 89 ) The following information on the Community industry is the aggregate data of the four cooperating Community manufacturers .
5.1 Production , production capacity and capacity
( 90 ) Production , production capacity and capacity utilization developed as follows :
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Production ( in tons ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 88 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _ 91 _ BAR _
Production capacity ( in tons ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 90 _ BAR _ 84 _ BAR _ 84 _ BAR _
Capacity utilization ( in % ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 106 _ BAR _ 108 _ BAR _
( 91 ) As the above table shows , production fell by 9 % in the reference period .
to save costs , the production capacity was reduced by 16 % , which led to an increase in capacity utilization by 8 % .
5.2
( 92 ) The table below shows the inventories for the annual financial statements .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Inventories ( tonnes ) _ BAR _ BAR _ BAR _ BAR _ BAR
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 109 _ BAR _ 105 _ BAR _ 108 _ BAR _
( 93 ) Inventories increased by 8 % in the reference
the industry of the Community usually produces the affected goods on order
the level of inventstocks was therefore not found to be particularly ful for assessing the situation of the Community of the Community .
5.3 Sales volume , market share , growth and average unit prices in the Community .
( 94 ) The table below shows the sales of the Community industry to independent customers in the Community .
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Sales quantity ( in tons ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 97 _ BAR _ 99 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _
Market share _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 97 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _
average selling price ( EUR / ton ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _
( 95 ) The sales volumes and market share of the Community industry were constant during the reference period .
However , given view given the push of dumped ports into the Community , this was only achieved by 11 % prices average selling prices .
( 96 ) However , the decline in decline in 11 % does not significantly reflect the decline in prices in key market segments .
the affected goods are mainly used in the steel industry primarily to wall three types of vessels ( pans , converters and arc furnaces )
initially , the imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China consisted mainly of pan stones from the lower market segment .
in the reference period , however , a trend a trend penetthe higher segments of the converters and electric arc furnaces
Converters and electric arc furnaces must achieve a maximum service life , which means that more expensive stones of high quality must be used to increase the number of furnace trips before renewal of the lining .
an analysis of the sales structure in the reference period showed that the Community industry was focused towards lower volumes for the high-quality market segments to defend ose against the pressure of imports from the People Republic of China
this development shows that the average prices of some product types fell by more than 11 %
for example , the average price of the largest product group ( stones with 9 % residual carbon and melelt magnesia ) fell by 19 % the reference period .
( 97 ) In view of the increase in imports , the Community industry did not grow despite a reduction in its average prices .
Rather , he was forced to reduce production capacity and
5.4 Profitability
( 98 ) The profitability shown in the table below was calculated as a return on sales of sales on the Community market .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Profitability of Community sales _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 76 _ BAR _ 26 _ BAR _ 45 _ BAR _
( 99 ) Profitability declined significantly between 2001 and 2003 as a result of price reductions , which development coincided with the increase in dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China
in the UZ , profitability rose slightly again , which was primarily due to a reduction in costs .
Although the Community economy made in the UZ made profits , the profit margin was significantly lower than in this type of economy normally expected in the absence of dumped imports
As the table shows , the profitability in 2001 , when the market share of dumped imports was still relatively low , was much higher as expected .
5.5 Return on investment ( RoI ) , cash flow , investments and capital
( 100 ) The table below provides an overview of the development of return on investment , cash flow and investments
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Return on investment ( RoI ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 85 _ BAR _ 50 _ BAR _ 52 _ B
Cashflow _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 81 _ BAR _ 55 _ BAR _ 60 _ B
Investments _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 75 _ BAR _ 131 _ BAR _ 134 _ BAR
( 101 ) The table shows that the return on investment has largely developed in parallel to the return on sales ( see above )
cash flow follows roughly the same trend , i.e. , it is declining from 2001 to 2003 and recovers slightly in the UZ .
the decline in return on investment and cash flow reflects the fact that the average selling prices decrelined faster than the average cost of the goods sold .
( 102 ) The Community industry has increased its investment .
they served mainly for the renewal of existing plants and machines , less for the construction of new production facilities .
( 103 ) However , the possibilities of the Community sector to raise capital from credit institutions or parent companies were not seriously impaired during the subscription period , because companies belong to larger corporations .
the capital creation opportunities are therefore primarily dependent on the strength of the Group and not necessarily on the circumstances in the branch of business concerned .
this factor should therefore be irrelevant to this investigation .
5.6 Employment , productivity and
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _

Wages _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 84 _ BAR _ 82 _ BAR _ 82 _ BAR _
( 104 ) As can be seen from the table , the Community the Community reduced the number of its employees from 2001 to the UZ .
the increase between 2003 and the UZ can be explained by an increase in
Productivity was largely constant in the reference period
( 105 ) Wages declined significantly in 2002 , but then remained constant until the UZ .
The reason for this was a restructuring programme that year , as the above development of production and employment shows .
5.7 Height of the actual dumping
( 106 ) The dumping ranges are listed in section on dumping
they are clearly above the low threshold
Moreover , the impact of the actual dumping range cannot be considered immrelevant given the volume and prices of dumped imports
5.8 Effects of previous dumping or subsidy practices .
( 107 ) The Community industry has not recovered from the impact of previous dumping or subsidy practices , as no investigations have been carried out in this respect .
5.9 Conclusion
( 108 ) While the sales volumes and market share in the Community remained relatively constant , the Community industry was confronted with a average decline of 11 % in the reference period , although it changed its product -@ Mix in favour of higher types product types .
notwiththe cost savings , the profit margin decreased noticeably , so that profits in the UZ were 55 % below the level of 2001 , the profit margin was well below the level that would have expected without dumped imports .
( 109 ) The deterioration in the situation of the Community industry in the reference period is also reflected in the reduction in production and production capacity , the decline in wages , employment , return on investment and cash flow , and a lack of growth despite 11 % in average prices .
( 110 ) These negative developments fell into a time of relatively constant productivity , increasing investments and better capacity utilization .
the development of the stocks and the capital creation opportunities was considered not meaningful for the reasons set out above .
( 111 ) Taking account all these indicators , it is provisionally concluded that the Community economic sector in the UZ was caused significant damage within the meaning of Article 3 of the Basic Regulation .
d . CAD
1 . Preliminary remark
( 112 ) It was also examined whether there was a causal link between dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China and the damage to the Community industry .
other known factors were examined than the dumped imports , which may have damaged the Community industry at the same time to ensure that any damage caused by these other factors was not attributed to dumped imports .
2 . Effects of imports from the People of
( 113 ) As previously shown above , the volume of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China rose by around 150 % and its market share by 118 % .
As set out in recital 85 , prices of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China also fell by 22 % and a significant price undercut was noted ( see Recital 86 ) .
in response to imports , the Community industry retained its sales volume ( in order to endanger economies of scale ) , but had to significantly reduce its prices .
This price reduction led , among other things , led to a decline in profitability of 55 % .
thus , profitability is significantly lower than expected in this type of industry ; this level is no longer sustainable .
3 . Effects of imports from third
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Imports from other countries other than the Republic of China _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 90 _ BAR _ 140 _ BAR _ 141 _ BAR _
( 114 ) It is highly unlikely that imports originating to third countries such as the Republic of Korea and Brazil may have contributed to the damage to the Community industry .
the market share of imports from countries than the People Republic of China was only around 3 % in the UZ .
Moreover , the average prices of imports from the Republic of Korea and Brazil ( i.e. the third countries , addition to the People &apos;s Republic of China , from which the largest quantities were imported ) were 25 % or 47 % higher than the prices of imports originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
In view of the share and the relatively high prices of imports from other third countries , it can concluded that these imports , if at all can have made a minimal contribution to damage to the Community sector .
4 . Effects of competition between Community manufacturers and overcapacity .
( 115 ) Some interested parties claimed that the Community industry had been forced to reduce its prices to a harmful level due to overcapacity of the refractory -@ industry .
However , the capacity utilization determined in the investigation for the period , the development of which is listed in indexed form under ital 90 , does not confirm this claim .
Rather , it was comparable to the capacity utilization of the steel industry and other similar industries .
even though capacity was clearly mined and prices fell , this was primarily a response to the increase in dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
the Commission also points out that , at the end the 1990s a comprehensive restructuring of the Community -@ industry took place the late 1990s .
5 . Effects of developments in the
( 116 ) It was claimed that the technical progress enabling the production of stones with a longer service life and efficient steel production had caused the damage to the Community industry .
During the investigation , several steel producers stated that their consumption of Magnesia -@ stones per tonne of steel had fallen as a result of technical progress .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Steel production EU at -@ 25 ( kilotons ) _ BAR _ 180531 _ BAR _ 180758 _ BAR _ 183441 _ BAR _ 185197 _ BAR _
Consumption of Magnesia and -@ stones EU at -@ 25 ( in tons ) _ BAR _ 399563 _ BAR _ 397203 _ BAR _ 401499 _ BAR _ 400638 _ BAR
Stone consumption in the steel industry ( tons per kilotonne ) _ BAR _ 2,21 _ BAR _ 2,20 _ BAR _ 2,19 _ BAR _ 2,16 _ BAR _
this table shows that Magnesia near -@ stones have only a share of about 2 % of steel production .
a decline in this share would therefore not explain the decline in selling prices and profitability described in the section on damage .
for this reason , it is held that the higher technical quality of the stones cannot have been a main cause of the damage to the Community industry .
( 117 ) The investigation revealed that some steel producers continue to produce a certain proportion of Magnesia fil-@ stones themselves .
However , there are no signs that this practice would have been extended over time .
Moreover , as no steel company as a manufacturer of nesia -@ Steinen worked to the investigation , it can be assumed that this production sector had no impact on the economic situation of the Community industry .
6 . Effects of exchange rate fluctuations
( 118 ) Another factor allegedly responsible for the damage was the change in the exchange rate of the dollar and euros .
This could be relevant as the Chinese renminbi was linked to the dollar for many years ; allegedly , the fluctuations in the exchange rate of dollar and have made exports to the community more attractive to Chinese manufacturers
( 119 ) However , the price loss of the dollar against the euro did not always coincide with the increase in imports .
the decline in the dollar price began in June 2002 , while imports rose significantly as early as 2001 .
Moreover , the freight costs from the People &apos;s Republic of China to the Community in the reference period .
if imports from the People Republic of China would only increased because market conditions had improved as a of the exchange rate change , if a decline or , at least , a stabilisation of imports could be expected as soon as the increased freight costs compensated for the exchange rate change .
although such a compensation actually occurred ( in the last 15 months of the reference period , freight costs rose by around 25 % according to P &amp; O Nedlloyd ) , imports continued to increase
( 120 ) For this reason , it is provisionally concluded that the effects of exchange rate changes may hardly have contributed to damage to the Community economy .
7 . Effects of imports of the Community industry into the Community
( 121 ) Some interested parties claimed that the damage was self-caused because the Community &apos;s industry introduced the goods from the People &apos;s Republic of China
As set out above , imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China , in the case of RHI , which belongs to the Community industry , for 5 % of its total sales on the Community market .
the share and difference in the prices of these imports compared to Community sales are relatively low and cannot have had a major impact on the market .
8 . Effects of Community exports
( 122 ) In the UZ , the Community &apos;s industry carried out around 27 % of its production from the Community .
the export volume decreased only slightly during this period .
However , the profitability of these exports was higher than that of Community sales , so it cannot be claimed that they have contributed to damage to the Community economy .
9 . Conclusion on the cause of
( 123 ) As already set out , the damage in this case was primarily in the form of price pressure , which caused a decline in profitability .
Taking into account the fact that the prices of rapidly increasing imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China were well below those of the Community industry , nothing is nothing that the factors mentioned above could have been a major cause of the significant damage to the Community industry .
No other factors were found in the investigation that could have caused the significant damage .
( 124 ) The basis of this analysis of the impact of all known factors on the situation of the Community economic , it is provisionally concluded that there is a causal link between dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China and the significant damage to the Community industry .
E. COMMUNITY INTER
1 . General
( 125 ) It was examined whether there were elling reasons for the conclusion that the introduction of anti-dumping duties on imports from the country concerned would run counter to Community interest .
the Commission sent questionnaires to importers , industrial users and suppliers .
One of 14 users , five suppliers and three independent three independent introducporters .
( 126 ) On the basis of the information received by the cooperating parties , the following conclusions were drawn .
2 . Interest in the
( 127 ) As is well known , the Community industry consists of four manufacturers who employ around 800 employees in the production and sale of the goods concerned .
It should also be recalled that the economic indicators for the Community industry showed a deterioration in results in the reference period .
Despite the slight improvement in the UZ , the Community &apos;s industry was unable to achieve a satisfactory financial situation due to the dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
( 128 ) It is clear that in the event of waiver of measures , more and more production facilities in the Community are closed and the steel companies will be much more dependent on the Chinese goods .
There are currently only a few production facilities worldwide , and most of the raw materials ( especially magnesium oxide ) are located in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
for this reason , there are no major sources of supply in other third countries .
As a result , the introduction of anti-dumping measures would obviously benefit the Community industry
( 129 ) For these reasons , it is visionally concluded that the introduction of anti-dumping measures is in the interests of the Community sector
3 . Interest of independent
( 130 ) Four companies answered the questionnaire for independent importers , although only two of them introduced the goods in the UZ .
the cooperating importers opposed ed the introduction of measures and claimed that there were only a few large manufacturers of refractory products in the Community and the imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China had stimulated competition in the Community market .
if measures were introduced and prices rise , Chinese companies could reduce their sales in the Community and introducporters would suffer losses from reduced trade and lower profitability .
( 131 ) An importer argued that he had to close his business with eight employees , since the goods concerned had a significant share of his business activities
However , the aim of the anti-dumping measures is neither to prevent the import of the goods concerned , nor to make more difficult the activities of the importers in the Community .
As the proposed measures affect only a relatively small part of the total cost of the Community steel industry and there are business relations between Chinese executive manufacturers and users in the Community based on specific technical requirements , it likelihood the traditional business activities of importers will continue even if anti-dumping measures are introduced against dumped imports .
( 132 ) In addition , it was noted that an introduction of measures would no significant consequences for the other importer , as the goods concerned have only a share of less than 1 % of the company turnover .
4 . Interest of suppliers
( 133 ) The suppliers who worked on the investigation supported the procedure .
two companies supplsupplied the branch of the Community with the main raw material for Magnesia -stones ( stillilled magnesite ) , claimed that they had have to stopped the supply of the retory -a few years ago as first raw materials from the People Republic of China and later also nesia -stones from the People Republic of China came on the market .
5 . Interest of users
5.1 Preliminary remark
( 134 ) 14 User companies , i.e. steel producers , answered the questionnaire , and another manufacturer and the Steel Association sent opinions .
another user supported the request of the Community industry , but all other steel companies spoke opposed against the introduction of anti-dumping measures .
Overall , user companies accounted for around 38 % of the Community consumption of Magnesia fil-@ Steinen .
5.2 highly sensitive goods
( 135 ) Reffractory materials are of the utstrategic importance for the steel industry .
the entire steel passes through with Magnesia -@ stones brialled converters , stovaces and pans .
Supply difficulties could therefore have significant consequences in the form of production interruptions , repairs or security problems
for this reason , stones of high quality , i.e. long service life , and good technical support for this type of goods are very important .
due to the high technical requirements , a lot of time , high investments and research are required for the establishment of a supplier relationship .
even the switch from one Chinese manufacturer to another manufacturer would be very difficult .
the steel producers claimed that in the last two years , they had made progress with Chinese manufacturers and their introducporters in the Community , especially through by improving efficiency and innovation .
( 136 ) The takings objected to the introduction of measures therefore fear that there could be bottlenecks in the supply of high-quality stones and adequate technical support .
they are afraid that Chinese manufacturers would withdraw from the Community market in the event of the introduction of measures .
in , the largest occurrences of magnesite , the most important raw material for Magnesia -@ stones are located in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
the steel industry is therefore afraid that its relations with Chinese commodity suppliers could deteriorate .
( 137 ) As already stated above , the anti-dumping measures are not aimed at preventing the import of the goods concerned or to make the activity of the steel producers steel more difficult .
this means that non-harmful imports could be further introduced into the Community
Consequently , existing relations with Chinese execporters could be maintained even if anti-dumping measures were introduced compared to the dumped imports .
This is also supported by the fact that the goods concerned have only such an insignificant share of the total production costs of steel producers that measures would have only minor impact on the costs of the users ( see recital 142 ) .
( 138 ) It should also be noted that the goods concerned are of strategic importance for the steel industry
in the event of a waiof measures , there is a risk that the entire production of the goods concerned will be transferred to the People Republic of China in the long term .
Given that there are no major manufacturers in other third countries , such a dependence on Chinese imports is clearly not a sustainable scenario for the steel industry
( 139 ) In addition , there is no evidence that the raw material access of the steel producers that produce Magnesia -@ stones for own use could be difficult .
5.3
( 140 ) The user industry claimed that the measures would strengthen a market structure with few major manufacturers .
the users argued that this lack of competition was the result of mergers and acquisitions in the refractory -@ industry in the 1990s .
( 141 ) The largest manufacturer in the Community had a market share of around 30 % in the UZ , which should hardly be sufficient to control and control the market .
this is underpinned by the fact that this market share declined as a result of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
As stated above , these imports will in elihood continue even after the introduction of measures .
In addition , many small businesses in the community and even some steel companies themselves produce Magnesia @ stones , and during the investigation no evidence was presented that the major manufacturers in the community dominated the market in the claimed way .
since no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour has been presented , the claim remains unfounded and unproven .
5.4
( 142 ) The steel industry also arguted that anti-dumping duties on Magnesia -@ stones would incur additional costs on the highly price-sensitive steel market and , above all in competition with steel producers from third countries .
For this reason , anti-dumping duties would affect the competitiveness of the steel industry , especially as the pressure on the markets for other raw materials for steel products is also very strong
( 143 ) Nevertheless , the answers of the user industry to the questionnaire that Magnesia -@ stones are well below 1 % of the total cost .
Consequently , the proposed anti-dumping duties would only have marginal effects on the total cost of steel production .
the latest developments in the steel industry clearly show a recovery in selling prices and profitability , further reducing the share of Magnesia -@ stones total sales .
5.5 Conclusion on the interests of users
( 144 ) In view of the foregoing , it is unlikely that anti-dumping measures on the Community market would cut the supply or affect competition , especially as the Chinese Magnesia -@ Steine are likely continue to maintain their market share .
the increase in costs would only be marginal and would not significantly affect the competitiveness of the steel industry .
for these reasons , it is visionally held that the interests of users do not speak against the introduction of measures
6 . Conclusion on the Community
( 145 ) The introduction of measures against the imports of Magnesia fil-@ stones originating in the country concerned would clearly in the interests of the Community industry .
As for the importers / dealers and user industries , any impact on the prices of Magnesia -@ stones be minor .
However , the market share and profitability of the Community industry and the decline in its prices are clearly larger scope .
( 146 ) In view of the foregoing , it is provisionally concluded that no compelling reasons against the introduction of anti-dumping duties on the imports of Magnesia -@ stones originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
F. ANTIDUMPINGMASURE
1 . Damage removal threshold
( 147 ) In view of the conclusions on dumping , damage and Community interest , measures should be introduced to prevent further damage to the Community economy by dumped imports
( 148 ) Cuffs shall be set at a level sufficient to eliminate the damage caused by these imports without exceedthe detected dumping range
when determining the customs rate required to eliminate the impact of harmful dumping , it was assumed that any measures should enable the Community industry to cover its production costs and to achieve a overall an adequate pre-tax profit that could be achieved by an sector of this kind in the sector under normal competitive conditions , i.e. without dumped imports , the sale of the similar goods in the Community
in this calculation , a profit margin before taxes of 8 % of sales was based on the basis of the profit margins before the occurrence of dumped imports .
on this basis , an non-harmful price of the similar goods was determined for the sector of the Community .
the non-harmful price was determined on the basis of production costs plus the aforementioned profit margin of 8 % .
( 149 ) The necessary price increase was then determined by comparing the weighed average import price with the non-harmful price
the import prices were corrected by 10 % upwards for three reasons .
Firstly , the production facilities of the Community industry were near the steel mills , while the cost of transport from the import port and the insurance costs for imports were usually higher .
Secondly , the price that the Community industry accouncharged to the respective steel mills for sale included technical support , which was usually not the case with extors .
Thirdly , all sales of the Community industry were place at the level of end consumers , while many import business was at the level of traders who had additional costs .
( 150 ) Any differences arising in the comparison were expressed as percentage of the average cif fil-@ import value .
the comparison was made on the basis of the product groups formed according to PCN -@ numbers ( see Recital 11 ) .
( 151 ) The provisional weighed damage gins for companies that were granted either individual treatment or market economy status were ted to :
- Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 17.1 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 42,1 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Kyushu Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 21,9 % _ BAR
- Yingkou Guangyang Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 21,9 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Qinghua Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 54.6 % _ BAR _
- Dashiqiao Sanqiang Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 66.1 % . _ BAR _
( 152 ) In connection with the calculation of the nationwide damage removal threshold for all other exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China , it must taken into account that cooperation was low .
For this reason , a range was calculated based on the data of those cooperating exporters who whom neither MWB nor IB was granted .
as this damage removal threshold was lower than the highest damage margin in the case of the companies listed above , and in order not to reward non-cooperation , the nationwide damage range was set at the level of the highest range above , i.e. 66.1 % .
2 . Preliminary measures
153 ) On the basis of the foregoing , was considered that , pursuant to Article 7 ( 2 ) of the General Regulation , provisional anti-dumping duties should be imported on the imports of the concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
in accordance with the lower customs rule , the anti-dumping duties should be set at the amount of the dumping or damage range , depending on the one of both two .
since the cooperation was low , the residual range in the amount of the highest for the cooperating executive manufacturers , i.e. in the amount of 66.1 % of the cif -@ price free limit of the Community , unpaid .
the company-specific anti-dumping tariffs specified in this Regulation were set on the basis of the findings of this investigation .
they reflect the situation of the companies during this
In contrast to the nationcustoms duties for &quot; all other companies &quot; , these customs rates therefore apply exclusively to the imports of the goods that originate in the country concerned and are manufactured by the legal named legal persons .
Goods imported by other companies not referred to by name and address the part of this decision , including the companies affilibusiness with the expressly mentioned companies , are not subject to these individual tariffs , to customs applicable to &quot; all other companies &quot; .

( 2 ) In accordance with the refund nominal clature , cheese will be eligible for export refund if they meet minimum requirements for milk dry mass and milk fat .
a type of cheese produced in certain new Member States could meet these requirements , but not enjoy a refund because it does not fall under the current classification system of export refund nomclature .
due to the importance of this cheese for the dairy industry , retailers and the respective milk producers , it is appropriate to add a product code under the position &quot; other cheese &quot; , so that the cheese can be classified into the export refund nomenclature .
3 . The quantities requested for requested in the &apos; Cheese &apos; export licences shall constantly exceed the profile of the export restrictions applicable to the Community on the Convention Agriculture the concluded in the multilateral trade negotiations of the Uruguay Round .

in these circumstances , in view of the numerous applications for the grant of export ences for cheese , it is appropriate to apply this provision to all types of cheese exception .
( 5 ) In accordance with footnote 10 applicable to grated cheese , cheese in powder form and melprocessed elt cheese in Annex I Sec9 of Regulation ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 , non-milk components shall not taken into account when calculating reimbursement .
this determination must be extended to all types of cheese and the non-milk components must be described in more detail
for the execporter and even to a greater extent for the competent authority , it can be very difficult or even impossible to determine the weight of these components .
therefore it is advisable to reduce the refund by a standard amount .
( 6 ) The refund shall be granted for the net weight of the
in cases where the cheese is wrapped with paraffin , ash or wax or wrapped plastic wrap , ambiguities may arise
it is envisaged that such enclosure is not part of the net weight of the product for the purpose of calculating the reimbursement .
for plastic wrap , paraffin and ash , it can be impossible for the export and the competent authority to determine the weight of these materials .
therefore it is advisable to reduce the refund by a standard amount .
( 7 ) Regulations ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 and ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 shall be amended accordingly

the COMMISSION OF EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,

After consulting the Advisory Committee ,
Considering the following reasons :
A. AN
1 . The Commission received an application pursuant to Article 13 ( 3 ) of the General Regulation to investigate the alleged bypassing of anti-dumping measures against imports of certain ring binder mechanics originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China ( hereinafter referred to as the People Republic of China &quot; ) .
( 2 ) The application was submitted on 28 February 2005 by Ring Alliance Ringbuchtechnik GmbH on behalf of joint manufacturers , which accounts for more than 70 % of the joint production of certain ring binder mechanics .
B. WARE
( 3 ) The goods affected by the alleged bypass are ring binmechanics normally assigned to the KN fil-@ code ex83051000 , originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
this KN enam-@ code is only specified for the of information .
( 4 ) The commodity which the subject of the investigation are certain binback mechanics sent from the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; examined goods &quot; ) and which are assigned to same N -@ code as the goods with originating in the People Republic of Republic of China .
C. GELTENEN MEASURES
( 5 ) The measures currently and possibly measures are a final anti-dumping duty introduced by Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2074 / 2004 &#91; 2 &#93; , was extended to the imports of the same goods shipped from Vietnam &#91; 3 &#93; .

the following evidence was
- According to the request , the trade structure has changed significantly due to a significant increase in imports of the goods examined , while the imports of the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China declined after the introduction of measures , for which there is no sufficient justior justification apart from the introduction of customs .
- This change in the trade structure seems to be due to the oshipment of certain binder mechanics ating in the People &apos;s Republic of China into the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos and / or the assembly of certain binder mechanics in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos .
- In addition , the request contains sufficient of evidence that the remedy effect of the anti-dumping measures applicable to the goods concerned originating in the People Republic of China is undermined both in terms of the quantity and prices .
Apparently , significant quantities of imports of certain ring binder mechanics from the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos have replaced the imports of the goods originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
- Furthermore , there is sufficient evidence that the examined are sold at prices that are dumpcompared to the normal originally determined for certain ring binmechanics originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
- If , in addition to dispatch on the People &apos;s Republic of the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos , other bypass practices within the meaning of Article 13 of the Basic Regulation are established , the investigation may also extend to these practices .

Council Regulation ( EC ) No 564 / 2005
of 8 April 2005
to amending Regulation No. 1601 / 2001 establishing a definitive anti-dumping duty and the final appropriation of the preliminary anti-dumping duty on imports of certain cables and ropes of iron or steel originating in the Czech Republic , Russia , Thailand and Turkey
the COUNCIL of THE EUROPEAN UN
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 384 / 96 of 22 December 1995 on the protection dumped imports from countries not belonging to the European Community &#91; 1 &#93; ( hereinafter referred to as the &apos; Basic Regulation &quot; ) , in particular to Article 11 ( 3 ) ,
on a proposal from the Commission after consultations in the Advisory Committee ,
Considering the following reasons :
A. PREPARER PROCEDURE
( 1 ) On 5 May 2000 , the Commission an anti-dumping procedure &#91; 2 &#93; concerning the imports of certain cables and ropes made of iron or steel originating in , among other things , Turkey .
( 2 ) This procedure ultimately led to the introduction of a final anti-dumping duty with Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 &#91; 3 &#93; in order to eliminate the harmful effects of dumping .
ANTRY ON INLEITTION of an INTERIMM ATION
( 3 ) Has Çelik ve Halat Sanayi Ticaret A.S. ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; Has Çelik &quot; or &quot; applicant &quot; ) , a Turkish executive manufacturer of certain cables and ropes made iron or steel subject to the applicable dumping measures , applied for a partial interim review of Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 .
4 . This request in accordance with Article 11 ( 3 ) of the General Regulation , it argued that the circumstances relating to the dumping on the basis of which the applicable measures were introduced have changed and that these changes are permanent .
( 5 ) According to the application , the applicant made structural changes that had a significant impact on the normal value .
In addition , the applicant argued that a comparison of the normal value based on his expense or domestic prices with export prices to the Community would result in a dumping margin that was significantly below the anti-dumping duty of 17.8 % applicable to imports he produced .
therefore , a maintenance of the measures at their current level , which based on the previously determined dumping range , is no longer necessary to compensate for the dumping .
( 6 ) After consultations in the Advisory Committee , the Commission concluded that there was sufficient evidence to justify the opening of a partial interim review , so that it published a relevant notice &#91; 4 &#93; and began with an investigation limited to determining the existence of dumping among the applicant .
C. PROCE
7 . The Commission formally informed the representatives of the export country and the applicant of the opening of the partial interim review and gave all parties directly the opportunity to present their position in writing and to request a hearing .
the Liaison Committee of the European Foundation of the Wire Rope Industries &quot; EWRIS ( the applicant in previous proceedings ) sent an opinion .
( 8 ) The Commission also sent the applicant with a questionnaire which he answered within the deadline set in the announcement .
( 9 ) The Commission obtained obtain all information deemed necessary for the dumping investigation , examined it and carried out a inspection visit to the applicant &apos;s operation .
( 10 ) The dumping investigation concerned the period 1 July 2003 to 29 February 2004 ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; investigation period &quot; ) .
d . WARE

similar goods
( 12 ) Like the previous investigation , the review showed that the SWR , which the applicant produces in Turkey sells or carries out into the Community , have the same basic material properties and uses so that they are be regarded as similar ty within the meaning of Article 1 ( 4 ) of the General Regulation .
E. DUMP
Normal value
( 13 ) In the course of the determination of the normal value , it was initially examined whether the domestic sales of the similar goods made by the applicant were representative of the Community compared to its export sales .
this was the case because the quantities sold , in accordance with Article 2 ( 2 ) of the General Regulation , ded to at least 5 % of total export sales to the Community .
( 14 ) Subsequently , each of the types sold by the applicant on the domestic market , which according to the results , directly comparable to the types carried out the Community was examined whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative within the meaning of Article 2 ( 2 ) of the General Regulation .
this was considered given if the total amount of domestic sales of a type in the investigation period was at least 5 % of the total amount of export sales of the same type to the Community .
for most of the types carried out to the Community during the investigation period , a comparable type sold in representative quantities on the domestic market could be determined .
( 15 ) For the types of goods that reached the 5 % threshold , it was then checked whether domestic sales could be regarded as transactions in normal trading by determining the share of profitable sales to independent customers .
in all cases , more than 80 % of the total domestic sales of the respective type were profitable , so the normal was based on the weighed average of all domestic sales in the investigation period .
( 16 ) For the types carried out in the Community , for which according to the results , no comparable types were sold on the domestic market , the normal value in accordance with Article 2 ( raphs 3 and 6 of the Basic General Regulation ance was calculated on the basis of the manufacturing costs &apos;s manufacturing costs for the types in question plus an appropriate amount for sales , administrative and overcosts ( hereinafter hereinreferred to as &quot; VG -@ Costs &quot; ) and for profits .
the VG frank-@ Kosten were based on those that the applicant recorded for domestic sales of the similar goods .
the profit margin was based on those that the applicant achieved for domestic sales of the similar goods in normal trade .

17 . Since all exports of the goods concerned were sold directly to independent customers in the Community , the export price was determined in accordance with Article 2 ( 8 ) of the General Regulation on the basis of the prices actually paid or paid .

( 18 ) The comparison of the normal value with the export price took made at the level ex works and at the same trading level .
in the interest of a fair settlement , in accordance to Article 2 ( paragraph 10 of the Basic Ordinance , corrections were made on request for demonstraaffecting the prices and their comparability in the factors of transport costs , insurance costs , provision , loading and ancillary costs , borrowing costs and commissions .
Dumping
( 19 ) In accordance with Article 2 ( paragraph 11 of the General Ordinance , the weighed average corrected value for each product type , the determining each dof range was compared with the weighed average net export price from the factory of the comparable type of goods .
( 20 ) This comparison revealed that there was no dumping .
F. DURERHS CHANGE OF THE ENVINIS
( 21 ) In accordance with Article 11 ( 3 ) of the General Regulation , it was also examined whether it could be assumed that the circumstances have changed permanently .
( 22 ) In this respect , the investigation revealed that the applicant had made structural changes with a significant impact on production and organization , which caused significantly higher production efficiency and thus a decline in production costs , so that the normal was lower than that in the investigation period of the previous investigation ( 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000 ) .
during the same period , export prices rose , and the investigation showed no indications that this increase was only temporary .
( 23 ) It shall therefore be concluded that circumstances have changed permanently ably , in particular to the increase in prices of exports to the Community and the simultaneous decline in production costs
g . ANTIDUMPINGMASU
( 24 ) As no dumping has been established , the measures against the applicant should be lifted .
( 25 ) The interested parties were informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which an amendment to Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 should be recommended were given the opportunity to comment .
( 26 ) The ERIS then sent some general comments , which essentially concerned the rising raw material prices after the investigation period .
the EMRIS did not question the above dumping findings , but expressed the concern that the applicant could practice dumping again .
( 27 ) With regard to raw material prices , it should be noted that they may have increased after the investigation period , but this not be taken into account in the dumping investigation for the applicant .
in the present case , the most important raw material rolled wire , a simple steel product , whose prices usually fluctuate quickly
therefore , an increase in the prices of such a raw material cannot be seen as a permanent change that could invalidate the above findings .
28 . , should be noted that the measures are only lifonly for the applicant and not for Turkey as a whole , so that in accordance with Article 11 ( 6 ) of the General Regulation , the applicants remain included in the procedure and can be re-examined in the context of a later review carried out for Turkey
