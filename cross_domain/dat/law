3 . Normal value
3.1 Determination of the normal value for all manufacturers without MWB
a ) Comparative country
( 35 ) Pursuant to Article 2 ( 7 ) of the Basic Regulation , the normal value in the case of imports from countries without a market economy and , if companies cannot be granted an MWB , the normal value must be determined from countries referred to in Article 2 ( 7 ) ( b ) of the Basic Regulation on the basis of the price or the mathematically determined value in a comparative country .
( 36 ) In the announcement of the initiation of the proceedings , the Commission had proposed to Turkey as an appropriate comparative country to determine the normal value of the People &apos;s Republic of China and invited the interested parties to submit an opinion on this respect .
( 37 ) Some interested parties objected to this proposal .
the most important arguments they put forward against Turkey were :
- lack of competition in the Turkish domestic market ( there are only three manufacturers in Turkey ) ;
- production in Turkey corresponds to 1.3 % of Chinese production ;
- the cost structure of Chinese manufacturers differs from that of Turkish manufacturers , particularly in terms of labour and raw material costs ;
- the economic and cultural relations of the People &apos;s Republic of China and those of Turkey with the EU differ because Turkey is closer to Europe , has benefited from a customs union with the EU since 1995 and approximates its legislation in the light of the negotiations on Turkey &apos;s accession to the EU to the EU--@ standards ;
- the Turkish currency lost much in value ; some Turkish manufacturers are associated with applicants ;
- the quality of the Turkish goods is too low .
( 38 ) The interested parties proposed India or Russia as suitable comparative countries .
( 39 ) The Commission sought to work from other potential comparative countries such as Russia , India , Japan , South Korea , the United States of America , Serbia and Montenegro and South Africa .
Of the 38 companies around the world with which she contacted , only two companies in the US agreed to participate .
( 40 ) The analysis of the available information revealed that there is competition for the affected goods with at least three manufacturers , around 30 suppliers , more than 15 importers and around 300 users .
According to the results of the investigation , as mentioned under recital 14 , the goods concerned and the Magnesia -@ stones manufactured in the People &apos;s Republic of China or the USA and sold on the domestic markets were similar .
In addition , the study revealed that more than 50 % of the raw materials used by one of the US -@ American manufacturers were imported from the People &apos;s Republic of China and that the manufacturing processes in the two countries did not differ significantly .
( 41 ) This provisionally concludes that the United States of America was the most appropriate and acceptable comparative country within the meaning of Article 2 ( 7 ) of the Basic Regulation .
b ) Determination of the normal value
( 42 ) In accordance with Article 2 ( 7 ) ( a ) of the Basic Regulation , the normal value for those exporting manufacturers who have not been granted MWB was determined on the basis of the verified information provided by the manufacturer in the comparative country .
since the sales of the US -@ American manufacturers were transactions in normal trade , the normal value for the types of goods , which were comparable to the types of goods exported from the People &apos;s Republic of China to the Community was determined on the basis of the prices paid or paid on the US -@ American domestic market .
( 43 ) The normal value was the weighted average domestic sale price charged by the cooperating US -@ American manufacturers to independent customers for product types with comparable MgO -@ salary .
Corrections have been made for the different treatments of the different types of goods .
3.2 Determination of the normal value for the executing manufacturers to whom an MWB has been granted
( 44 ) It should be recalled that the dumping margin for the companies to which an MWB was granted has been determined on the basis of their information on domestic sales and production costs for the goods concerned .
this data has been audited in the companies of the companies concerned .
( 45 ) In order to determine the normal value , the Commission first examined for each cooperating manufacturer whether the entire domestic sales of the goods concerned were representative compared to the total export sales to the Community .
in accordance with Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation , domestic sales were considered representative if the total volume of these sales of each executing manufacturer corresponded to at least 5 % of the total volume of the manufacturer &amp; apos ; s export sales to the Community .
( 46 ) On this basis , it was determined that the domestic sales of the affected goods of an executing manufacturer were representative in the UZ .
the domestic sales of the affected goods of the other executing manufacturer in the UZ were not representative .
( 47 ) For the exuting manufacturer with representative domestic sales , the Commission then identified the types of goods sold on the domestic market , which were identical or directly comparable to the types sold for export to the Community .
( 48 ) For each type sold on the domestic market which , according to the results of the investigation was directly comparable to a type sold for export to the Community , it was examined whether the domestic sales were sufficiently representative within the meaning of Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation were sufficiently representative .
the domestic sales of a certain type of goods were considered sufficiently representative if the total volume of domestic sales of this type in the UZ corresponded to 5 % or more of the total volume of export sales of the comparable type of goods to the Community .
( 49 ) This analysis showed that the executing manufacturer with overall representative sales did not sell all types of goods in Germany in representative quantities .
( 50 ) Subsequently , the Commission examined whether the domestic sales of the individual types of goods sold in representative quantities on the domestic market could be regarded as transactions in normal trade , identifying the share of profitable sales to independent customers was determined .
( 51 ) Domestic sales were considered profitable if the unit price of the respective type of goods corresponded to at least the production costs .
therefore , the production costs were determined for each type of goods sold in the UZ on the domestic market .
( 52 ) As mentioned in recitals 50 and 51 , the share of profitable sales of the type of goods in question to independent customers on the domestic market was determined .
in cases where the sales quantity of a type sold at a net selling price in the amount of the computercally determined production costs or above corresponded to 80 % or more to the total sales volume of that type and in which the weighted average price of the type in question was at least corresponded to the production costs , the normal value was based on the actual domestic price , which was determined as the weighted average of the prices of all domestic sales made in the UZ , regardless of whether these sales were profitable or not .
In cases where the volume of profitable sales of a type accounted for less than 80 % of the total sales volume of the type in question , or where the weighted average price of the type in question was below the production costs , the normal value was based on the actual domestic price , which was calculated as the weighed average of only the profitable sales , provided that the volume of these sales accounted for 10 % or more of the total sales volume of the type in question .
( 53 ) If the profitable sales of a type account for less than 10 % of the total sales volume , it was held that the sales volumes of this type were not sufficient to use the domestic price as an appropriate basis for determining the normal value .
( 54 ) The above analysis showed that certain types of goods were sold in normal trade .
( 55 ) For all types of goods which were either not sold in representative quantities or - due to the invoiced prices - not in normal trade ( cf . Recitals 52 and 53 ) , the domestic prices of the manufacturer in question could not be used to determine the normal value , so that another method had to be used .
( 56 ) In cases where the domestic prices of a certain type sold by a contractor could not be used , the normal value had to be determined on the basis of the costs of the manufacturer in question .
the normal value was determined in accordance with Article 2 ( 3 ) of the Basic Regulation by adding an appropriate amount for the selling , administrative and overhead costs ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; VG -@ costs &quot; ) and an appropriate profit margin to the production costs of the types carried out .
To this end , the Commission examined whether the VG -@ costs and the profits recorded by the company domestically were reliable .
( 57 ) The actual VG -@ costs were considered reliable if the total volume of the domestic sales of the entity concerned could be considered representative compared to the volume of export sales to the Community .
the domestic profit margin was determined on the basis of the domestic sales of the types sold in normal trade .
This was done on the basis of the method set out under recitals 45 , 48 , 52 and 53 .
for a company , the actually recorded VG -@ costs and profits could be used , because it met the aforementioned criteria .
( 58 ) For the other company whose domestic sales were not representative , the normal value was determined in accordance with Article 2 ( 6 ) ( c ) of the Basic Regulation .
According to the test results , the cost structure of the other company with MWB and representative domestic sales for only a few types of goods showed such deviations that it was not a justifiable basis for determining the normal value .
However , the costs of the company , whose domestic sales were not representative , were reliable , so that the normal value was determined on the basis of the data of the company , which corresponded to those of the other exporters / manufacturers of the same goods in that country of origin .
4 . Export prices
( 59 ) All export sales to the community of exporters with MWB or IT were handled either through affiliated importers in the Community , affiliated importers outside the Community or through companies that were not associated with the executive manufacturers but worked closely with them or even had the exclusive distribution rights .
in cases where exports via affiliated companies were sold , export prices have been mathematically calculated in accordance with Article 2 ( 9 ) of the Basic Regulation .
in all cases where the exports of the goods concerned went to independent customers in the Community , the export price was calculated in accordance with Article 2 ( 8 ) of the Basic Regulation was calculated on the basis of the export prices actually paid or paid .
( 60 ) Pursuant to Article 2 ( 9 ) of the Basic Regulation , corrections have been made for all costs incurred by the importer between import and resale , including the VG -@ costs and a reasonable profit margin .
In this case , the profit margin actually recorded by the cooperating independent importers was seen as a reasonable basis .
5 . Comparison
( 61 ) The normal value and export prices were compared at the factory level and at the same trading level .
in the interests of a fair settlement , in accordance with Article 2 ( 10 ) of the basic Regulation , corrections were made for differences which demonstrably influenced the prices and comparability of prices .
( 62 ) These corrections related to differences in transport , insurance , deployment , loading and ancillary costs , borrowing costs , commissions , import duties and customer service costs ( guarantee ) .
6 . Dumping span
6.1 Cooperating manufacturers to whom an MWB / IB has been granted
( 63 ) In the case of the two undertakings to which an MWB has been granted , in accordance with Article 2 ( 11 ) of the Basic Regulation compared the weighted average normal value of the individual types of the goods concerned into the Community was compared with the weighted average export price of the corresponding type in accordance with Article 2 ( 11 ) of the Basic Regulation .
( 64 ) In the case of the four undertakings to which an IB has been granted , Article 2 ( 11 ) of the Basic Regulation compared the weighted average standard value of the individual types of the goods concerned exported to the Community was compared with the weighted average export price of the corresponding type .
( 65 ) The provisional weighed average dumping margins , expressed as a percentage of cif -@ prices free limit of the community , unpaid , achieve the following values :
- Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 11.2 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 34.1 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Guangyang Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 55.7 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Kyushu Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 55.7 % _ BAR _
- Dashiqiao Sanqiang Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 99.9 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Qinghua Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 41.4 % . _ BAR _
6.2 For all other executing manufacturers
( 66 ) In order to calculate the dumping margin for all other exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China , the Commission first determined the scope of the cooperation .
To this end , it compared the total imports determined on the basis of the Eurostat -@ statistics according to the total imports of the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China with the responses of the cooperating exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China to the questionnaire .
after that , the cooperation was low .
( 67 ) In view of the low cooperation , the dumping margin was set for all other exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China in the amount of the highest dumping margin determined for the cooperating executive manufacturers , namely 99.9 % of the cif -@ price free border of the Community , unpaid .
However , according to the findings , the nationwide dumping margin was higher than the residual damage margin .
C. DAREDING
1 . Community production
( 68 ) In this study it was found that Magnesia -@ stones were manufactured by :
- two applicants co-producers and two other manufacturers working fully with the Commission during the investigation ( RHI , LWB , Refractarios Burceña S.L. and Ceramica del Nalon S.A. ) ;
- a manufacturer who answered the questionnaire in detail but spoke out against the procedure ( Refratechnik ) ;
- seven other manufacturers and Assopiatrelle ( the Italian Association of Fire Festival -@ Industrie , which represents a production of 64000 tons ) , which supported the Community industry , but did not answer the questionnaire in detail .
another manufacturer sent a letter , but expressed neither approvingly or objection .
2 . Definition of the Community industry
2.1 Manufacturers or manufacturers associated with the People &apos;s Republic of China who import the affected goods from the People &apos;s Republic of China
( 69 ) The investigation revealed that two of the cooperating manufacturers in the Community , namely RHI and Refratechnik , also imported the affected goods from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
For this reason , it was examined whether these undertakings should be excluded from the Community industry in accordance with Article 4 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the basic Regulation .
2.1.1 RHI
( 70 ) RHI produces in the community , but also introduces the affected goods but also from a associated Joint -@ Venture -@ company in the People &apos;s Republic of China , RHI Liaoning .
it was found that in the UZ the majority of RHI &apos;s joint sales were produced in the Community and that only a small proportion came from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
This share is low , as the Chinese production of RHI is primarily intended for the fast-growing Asian market .
RHI is also the largest producer in the Community , and its headquarters , the R &amp; amp ; D -@ center and the largest production facilities are located in the Community .
For this reason , it was found that the core business of RHI with the goods concerned is located in the Community .
( 71 ) It was then examined the impact of the sale of the imported goods on the total sales of the company in the Community .
the investigation found that RHI had no significant profitability benefits from the resale of imports .
This resulted in a comparison of the profitability of cooperating Community producers .
( 72 ) In view of the low proportion of imports and the fact that these imports had no significant positive impact on the profitability of Community sales as a whole , this company was not immune from the negative effects of harmful dumping .
For this reason , the view is held that it would not be justified to exclude RHI from the Community industry .
2.1.2 Refratechnik
( 73 ) Refratechnik also produces the affected goods in the community and introduces them from manufacturers in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
The investigation revealed that almost half of the company &apos;s joint sales in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
It was also noted that the expansion of business activities was largely made possible by an increase in imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
For this reason , it was believed that the core business of Refratechnik is located not only in the community , but also in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
( 74 ) Subsequently , it was examined how the sales initiated affected the Company &amp; apos ; s total sales in the Community .
The investigation revealed that , unlike RHI , Refratechnik had a considerable benefit from the resale of imports .
( 75 ) In view of the high proportion of imports in the total volume of sales in the Community and the fact that the core business appears to be gradually transferred to the People &apos;s Republic of China and Refratechnik clearly had a benefit from dumped imports , it was held that Refratechnik should be excluded from the Community industry in accordance with Article 4 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the basic regulation and should be regarded as &quot; other market participant &quot; .
2.2 Community industry
( 76 ) The production of the four Community producers who worked without fully in the investigation , including RHI and without refratechnik , amounted to 233732 tonnes during the period under investigation , representing 53 % of the total Community production , thus forming the Community industry within the meaning of Articles 4 ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) ( 4 ) of the Basic Regulation .
( 77 ) The investigation did not yield the self-consumption of the affected goods for the Magnesia -@ Steine producing industry .
some steel companies , on the other hand , produced Magnesia -@ stones for self-consumption .
However , this quantity was low compared to the production volumes of the refractory industry in the community .
since this production is intended for self-consumption in the steel industry and none of the companies in the steel industry worked as a manufacturer of Magnesia -@ Steinen ( although many of them received questionnaires ) , this part of production seems to have no significant impact on the Community industry .
( 78 ) As the Community industry consisted of four companies and two of these companies accounted for around 2 % of the production volume , the following figures for the Community industry was indexed for reasons of confidentiality .
3 . Community consumption
( 79 ) Consumption was determined on the basis of estimates from the industry transmitted to the Community industry according to usual practice .
The calculation of this data was carried out on the basis of steel production ( source : relevant reports from the International Iron and Steel Institute - IISI ) , divided by the average quantity of the goods concerned for the production of a tonne of steel .
( 80 ) The import volumes were determined on the basis of the Eurostat -@ data for the relevant KN -@ codes ( 68159100 , 68159910 , 68151010 , 68159990 , 69021000 and 69039020 ) .
Deductions of the quantities determined , deductions were carried out for those goods which were clearly not the goods concerned in view of their price .
the net quantities resulting after deduction ( 73291 tonnes for all countries ) and 59831 tonnes for the People &apos;s Republic of China ) were compared with the import volumes specified by the cooperating executive manufacturers in the People &apos;s Republic of China ( around 42,000 tonnes ) .
In view of the fact that about 13500 tonnes were imported from countries other than the People &apos;s Republic of China were imported , ( ii ) , according to the importers and users in the Community , the goods concerned were also imported by non-cooperating exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China and iii received many other executive manufacturers in the People &apos;s Republic of China received questionnaire , but did not cooperate , the view was taken that the Eurostat -@ statistics correctly record the import volumes .
In addition , a Chinese press release ( China Metallurgical News , January 4 , 2004 ) reported that 80,000 tonnes were exported to Europe in 2003 , indicating that the aforementioned Eurostat -@ figure is by no means too high for the UZ ( 59831 ) is by no means too high .
( 81 ) Sales of the Community industry on the Community market were identified on the basis of the verified responses from the five cooperating Community producers ( including Refratechnik ) to the questionnaire .
the remaining volumes ( i.e. consumption minus imports less sales of the Community industry ) were considered sales of non-cooperating Community producers .
( 82 ) The consumption determined in this way , the development of which is presented in the following table , shows that the demand for the goods concerned in the Community was practically constant during the reference period .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Community consumption _ BAR _ 399563 _ BAR _ 397203 _ BAR _ 401499 _ BAR _ 400638 _ BAR _
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 99 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _
4 . Imports from the country concerned into the Community
4.1 Market share of imports concerned
( 83 ) The volumes and market share of imports from the country concerned developed as follows :
Import quantities _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
VR China _ BAR _ 23980 _ BAR _ 44542 _ BAR _ 54181 _ BAR _ 59831 _ BAR _
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 186 _ BAR _ 226 _ BAR _ 250 _ BAR _
Market share of imports _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
VR China _ BAR _ 6,0 % _ BAR _ 11.2 % _ BAR _ 13.5 % _ BAR _ 14.9 % _ BAR _
( 84 ) While the consumption of Magnesia -@ bricks remained constant during the reference period , imports from the country concerned increased by around 150 % in the same period .
As a result , the market share of the People &apos;s Republic of China increased from 6.0 % to 14.9 % to more than double in the reference period .
4.2 Prices of imports and price undercut
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Prices of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China ( Source : Eurostat ) _ BAR _ 686 _ BAR _ 601 _ BAR _ 560 _ BAR _ 533 _ BAR _
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 88 _ BAR _ 82 _ BAR _ 78 _ BAR _
( 85 ) The table above shows the development of the average prices of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
Prices fell by 22 % in the reference period .
( 86 ) The prices invoiced on the Community market by the Community industry and the implementing producers in the country concerned in the UZ on the Community market have been compared .
the prices were compared after deduction of all discounts and quantity discounts .
the prices of the Community industry have been brought to the par ex works , and as import prices were based on the cif -@ prices free border of the Community were used as import prices .
( 87 ) The comparison showed that imports of the goods concerned were sold in the UZ in the Community at prices 16.6 % below the prices of the Community industry ( expressed as a percentage of the prices of the Community industry ) .
In view of this price undercut range and the development of the prices of the Community industry , it is clear that prices had already been significantly depressed .
5 . Situation of the Community industry
( 88 ) Pursuant to Article 3 ( 5 ) of the basic Regulation , the examination of the impact of dumped imports on the Community industry comprised an assessment of all economic factors and indices affecting the situation of the Community industry from 2001 ( base year ) to the UCC .
( 89 ) The following information on the Community industry is the aggregate data of the four cooperating Community producers .
5.1 Production , production capacity and capacity utilization
( 90 ) Production , production capacity and capacity utilization developed as follows :
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Production ( in tonnes ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 88 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _ 91 _ BAR _
Production capacity ( in tons ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 90 _ BAR _ 84 _ BAR _ 84 _ BAR _
Capacity utilization ( in % ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 106 _ BAR _ 108 _ BAR _
( 91 ) As the table above shows , production fell by 9 % in the reference period .
to save costs , production capacity was reduced by 16 % , resulting in an 8 % increase in capacity utilization .
5.2 Stock
( 92 ) The table below shows the inventories for the annual financial statements .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Stock ( in tonnes ) _ BAR _ BAR _ BAR _ BAR _ BAR _
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 109 _ BAR _ 105 _ BAR _ 108 _ BAR _
( 93 ) Inventories increased by 8 % in the reference area .
the Community industry generally produces the goods concerned on order .
the level of stocks was therefore not found to be particularly meaningful for assessing the situation of the Community industry .
5.3 Sales volume , market shares , growth and average unit prices in the Community
( 94 ) The table below shows the sales of the Community industry to independent customers in the Community .
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Sales quantity ( in tonnes ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 97 _ BAR _ 99 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _
Market share _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 97 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _
Average selling price ( EUR / ton ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _
( 95 ) The sales volumes and market share of the Community industry were constant during the reference period .
However , in view of the advance of dumped imports into the Community market , this could only be achieved by reducing average selling prices by 11 % .
( 96 ) However , the decline in average prices of 11 % does not reflect the decline in prices in key market segments .
In the steel industry , the affected goods are mainly used in the steel industry to remove out three types of vessels ( pans , converters and electric arc furnaces ) .
Initially , imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China consisted mainly of ladle stones from the lower market segment .
in the reference period , however , there was a trend towards the penetration of the higher segments of the converters and electric arc furnaces .
Converters and electric arc furnaces must achieve a maximum service life , which means that more expensive stones of high quality must be used to increase the number of furnace journeys before renewal of the lining .
an analysis of the sales structure during the reference period showed that the Community &amp; apos ; s industry was focused towards lower volumes for the high-quality market segments to defend itself against the pressure from imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
This development shows that the average prices of some types of goods decreased by more than 11 % .
For example , the average price of the largest group of goods ( stones with 9 % residual carbon and melting magnesia ) decreased by 19 % in the reference period .
( 97 ) In view of the increase in imports , the Community industry , despite a reduction in its average prices .
Rather , he was forced to reduce production capacity and jobs .
5.4 Profitability
( 98 ) The profitability reported in the table below was calculated to be a return on revenue of sales on the Community market .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Profitability of joint sales _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 76 _ BAR _ 26 _ BAR _ 45 _ BAR _
( 99 ) Profitability declined significantly between 2001 and 2003 as a result of the price reductions , which coincided with the increase in dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
in the UZ , profitability rose slightly again , which was primarily due to a reduction in costs .
While the Community industry made profits in the UZ , the profit margin was significantly lower than would normally be expected in this type of industry in the absence of dumped imports .
As the table shows , profitability in 2001 , when the market share of dumped imports was still relatively low , was much higher as expected .
5.5 Return on investment ( RoI ) , cash flow , investments and capital raising opportunities
( 100 ) The table below provides an overview of the development of return on investment , cash flow and investments .
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Return on investment ( RoI ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 85 _ BAR _ 50 _ BAR _ 52 _ BAR _
Cash flow _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 81 _ BAR _ 55 _ BAR _ 60 _ BAR _
Investments _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 75 _ BAR _ 131 _ BAR _ 134 _ BAR _
( 101 ) The table shows that the return on investment has broadly developed in parallel with the return on sales ( see above ) .
Cash flow follows approximately the same trend , i.e. it is declining from 2001 to 2003 and recovers slightly in the UZ .
the decline in return on investment and cash flow reflects the fact that average selling prices fell faster than the average cost of the goods sold .
( 102 ) The Community industry has increased its investment .
they were mainly used to renew existing plants and machines , less the construction of new production facilities .
( 103 ) However , the possibilities of the Community sector to raise capital from credit institutions or parent companies were not seriously impaired during the reference period because companies belong to larger corporations .
the capital raising opportunities are therefore primarily dependent on the strength of the Group and not necessarily on the circumstances in the affected business segment .
this factor should therefore be irrelevant for this investigation .
5.6 Employment , Productivity and Wages
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Number of employees _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 91 _ BAR _ 92 _ BAR _ 93 _ BAR _
Productivity ( ton / employees ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 96 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _
Wages _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 84 _ BAR _ 82 _ BAR _ 82 _ BAR _
( 104 ) As can be seen from the table , the Community industry reduced the number of its employees from 2001 to the UCZ .
The increase between 2003 and the UZ can be explained by an increase in production .
Productivity was largely constant in the reference period .
( 105 ) Wages declined significantly in 2002 , but then remained constant until the UZ .
The reason for this was a restructuring programme that year , as evidenced by the development of production and employment shows .
5.7 Amount of the actual dumping margin
( 106 ) The dumping margins are listed in the section on dumping .
they are clearly above the low threshold .
Moreover , the impact of the actual dumping margin cannot be considered irrelevant , given the volume and prices of dumped imports .
5.8 Effects of previous dumping or subsidy practices
( 107 ) The Community industry has not recovered from the effects of previous dumping or subsidy practices , as no investigations has yet been carried out .
5.9 Conclusion on damage
( 108 ) While sales volumes and market share in the Community remained relatively constant , the Community industry was confronted with a decline in average prices of 11 % in the reference period , although it changed its product -@ Mix in favour of higher-value types of goods .
Despite the cost savings , the profit margin declined noticeably , so that the profits in the UZ were 55 % below the level of 2001 , well below the level that would have been expected without dumped imports .
( 109 ) The deterioration in the situation of the Community industry during the reference period is also reflected in the reduction in production and production capacity , in the decline in wages , employment , return on investment and cash flow , and a lack of growth despite a 11 % reduction in average prices .
( 110 ) These negative developments fell into a period of relatively constant productivity , rising investment and better capacity utilization .
the development of inventories and capital raising opportunities was not regarded as meaningful for the reasons set out above .
( 111 ) Taking into account all these indicators , it shall be provisionally concluded that significant damage has been caused to the Community industry in the UCZ has been caused significant damage within the meaning of Article 3 of the Basic Regulation .
d . SCHADENSURSACHE
1 . Preliminary remark
( 112 ) It was also examined whether there was a causal link between dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China and the damage to the Community industry .
Other known factors other than dumped imports , which may have damaged the Community &amp; apos ; s industry at the same time , in order to ensure that any damage caused by these other factors was not attributed to dumped imports .
2 . Effects of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China
( 113 ) As has already been shown above , the volume of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China rose by around 150 % in the reference period and their market share by 118 % .
as set out in recital 85 , the prices of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China also fell by 22 % and a significant price undercut ( cf . Recital 86 ) .
In response to imports , the Community industry retained its sales volume ( so as not to jeopardise economies of scale ) , but had to significantly reduce its prices .
Among other things , this price reduction led , among other things , to a 55 % decline in profitability .
This means that profitability is significantly lower than in this type of industry ; this level is no longer sustainable .
3 . Impact of imports from third countries
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Imports from countries other than the People &apos;s Republic of China _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 90 _ BAR _ 140 _ BAR _ 141 _ BAR _
( 114 ) It is highly unlikely that imports originating in third countries such as the Republic of Korea and Brazil could have contributed to the damage to the Community industry .
The market share of imports from countries other than the People &apos;s Republic of China in the UZ was only around 3 % .
In addition , the average prices of imports from the Republic of Korea and Brazil ( i.e. third countries , in addition to the People &apos;s Republic of China , from which the largest quantities were imported ) were 25 % and 47 % higher than the prices of imports originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
In view of the market share and the relatively high prices of imports from other third countries , it can be concluded that these imports , if at all , have made only a minimal contribution to damaging the Community economy .
4 . Effects of competition between Community producers and overcapacity
( 115 ) Some interested parties claimed that the Community industry had been forced to reduce to a harmful level due to the overcapacity of the fire festival -@ industry had been forced to reduce its prices in competition to a harmful level due to overcapacity of the fire festival -@ industry .
However , the capacity utilization identified in the study for the reference period , the development of which is listed in indexed form under recital 90 , does not confirm this claim .
rather , it was comparable to the capacity utilization of the steel industry and other similar industries .
Although capacity was clearly dismantled and prices fell , this was primarily a response to the increase in dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
The Commission also points out that , as early as the end of the 1990s there was a comprehensive restructuring of the Community &amp; apos ; s -@ Community fire industry took place as early as the 1990s .
5 . Effects of developments in the steel industry
( 116 ) It has been claimed that the technical progress that enables the production of stones with a longer service life and efficient steel production has caused damage to the Community industry .
During the investigation , several steel producers explained that their consumption of magnesia -@ stcks per tonne of produced steel had fallen as a result of technical progress .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Steel production EU – -@ 25 ( kilotonnes ) _ BAR _ 180531 _ BAR _ 180758 _ BAR _ 183441 _ BAR _ 185197 _ BAR _
Consumption of Magnesia – -@ Steinen EU -@ 25 ( in tonnes ) _ BAR _ 399563 _ BAR _ 397203 _ BAR _ 401499 _ BAR _ 400638 _ BAR _
Stone consumption in the steel industry ( tonnes per kilotonne ) _ BAR _ 2,21 _ BAR _ 2,20 _ BAR _ 2,19 _ BAR _ 2,16 _ BAR _
this table shows that Magnesia -@ stones have only a share of about 2 % of steel production .
a decline in this share would therefore not explain the decline in selling prices and profitability described in the section on damage .
For this reason , it is considered that the higher technical quality of the stones could not have been a major cause for the damage to the Community industry .
( 117 ) The investigation showed that some steel producers continue to produce a certain proportion of Magnesia -@ Steinen themselves .
However , there is no evidence that this practice would have been expanded over time .
Furthermore , since no steel company as a manufacturer of Magnesia -@ Steinen , it can be assumed that this production sector had no impact on the economic situation of the Community industry .
6 . Effects of exchange rate fluctuations
( 118 ) Another factor allegedly responsible for the damage was the change in the exchange rate of the dollar and the euro .
This could be important as the Chinese renminbi has been linked to the dollar for many years ; allegedly , the fluctuations in the exchange rate of the dollar and the euro have allegedly made exports to the community more attractive to Chinese manufacturers .
( 119 ) However , the dollar ’ s price drop against the euro did not always coincide with the rise in imports .
The decline in the dollar exchange rate began in June 2002 , while imports rose significantly in 2001 .
Moreover , freight costs from the People &apos;s Republic of China to the Community increased considerably during the reference period .
If imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China had increased only because the market conditions had improved as a result of the exchange rate change , a decline or , in any case , a stabilisation of imports would have been expected as soon as the increased freight costs offset the exchange rate change .
Although such a compensation actually took place ( in the last 15 months of the reference period , freight costs increased by around 25 % , according to P &amp; O Nedlloyd ) , imports continued to increase .
( 120 ) For this reason , it is provisionally concluded that the effects of exchange rate changes could hardly have contributed to the damage to the Community industry .
7 . Effects of imports of the Community industry into the Community
( 121 ) Some interested parties claimed that the damage was self-caused because the Community industry imported the goods concerned from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
As already stated above , imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China accounted for 5 % of its total sales on the Community market in the case of RHI , which is part of the Community industry , accounted for 5 % of its total sales on the Community market .
The share and difference in the prices of these imports compared to Community sales are relatively small and cannot have had a major impact on the market .
8 . Effects of exports of the Community industry
( 122 ) In the UZ , the Community industry carried ted around 27 % of its production from the Community .
the export volume decreased only slightly during this period .
However , the profitability of these exports was higher than that of Community sales , so it cannot be said that they contributed to the damage to the Community industry .
9 . Conclusion on the cause of damage
( 123 ) As already stated , the damage in this case was primarily in the form of price pressure , which caused a decline in profitability .
Taking into account the fact that the prices of rapidly increasing imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China were well below those of the Community industry , there is nothing to suggest that the above-mentioned factors may have been a major cause of the significant damage to the Community &amp; apos ; s industry .
No other factors were found that could have caused the significant damage .
( 124 ) On the basis of this analysis of the impact of all the known factors on the situation of the Community sector , it is provisionally concludes that there is a causal link between dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China and the significant damage to the Community industry .
E. COMMUNITY INTERTS
1 . General considerations
( 125 ) It was examined whether there were compelling reasons for the conclusion that the introduction of anti-dumping duties on imports from the country concerned would run counter to Community interest .
the Commission sent questionnaires to importers , industrial users and suppliers .
Answers were received by one in 14 users , five suppliers and three independent importers .
( 126 ) The following conclusions were drawn on the basis of the information received by the cooperating parties .
2 . Interest of the Community industry
( 127 ) It is well known that the Community industry includes four manufacturers employing around 800 people in the production and sale of the goods concerned .
It should also be recalled that the economic indicators examined above for the Community industry showed a deterioration in business results during the reference period .
Despite the slight improvement in the UZ , the Community industry could not achieve a satisfactory financial situation due to dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
( 128 ) It is clear that , in the event of a waiver of measures , more and more production facilities in the Community will be closed and that steel companies will be much more dependent on Chinese goods .
There are currently only a few production facilities worldwide , and the majority of the raw materials ( mainly magnesium oxide ) are located in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
For this reason , there are no major sources of supply in other third countries .
As a result , the introduction of anti-dumping measures would obviously benefit the Community economy .
( 129 ) For these reasons , it is provisionally concluded that the introduction of anti-dumping measures would be in the interests of the Community industry .
3 . Interest of independent importers
( 130 ) Four companies answered the questionnaire for independent importers , although only two of them imported the goods concerned in the UZ .
the cooperating importers spoke out against the introduction of measures and claimed that there were only a few large producers of refractory products in the Community and that imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China had stimulated competition on the Community market .
Should measures were introduced and prices rise , Chinese companies might reduce their sales in the Community and importers would suffer losses due to reduced trade activity and lower profitability .
( 131 ) An importer argued that he may have to close his business with eight employees , since the goods concerned had a significant share in his business .
However , the aim of the anti-dumping measures is neither to prevent the import of the goods concerned , nor to make the activities of importers in the Community .
As the proposed measures concern only a relatively small part of the total cost of the Community &amp; apos ; s steel industry and there are business relations between Chinese executive manufacturers and Community users based on specific technical requirements , the traditional business activities of importers will continue even if anti-dumping measures are introduced in relation to dumped imports .
( 132 ) In addition , it was found that the introduction of measures would not have any significant consequences for the other importer , since the goods concerned only account for less than 1 % of the company &apos;s turnover .
4 . Interest of suppliers
( 133 ) The suppliers involved in the investigation supported the process .
two companies , which supplied the Community industry with the most important raw material for Magnesia -@ stones ( dead magnesite ) , claimed that they should have stopped supplying the fire festival -@ industry a few years ago , since first raw materials from the People &apos;s Republic of China and later also Magnesia -@ stones from the People &apos;s Republic of China came on the market .
5 . Interest of users
5.1 Preliminary remark
( 134 ) 14 user companies , i.e. steel producers , answered the questionnaire and another manufacturer and the Economic Association of Steel submitted their opinions .
Another user supported the request of the Community industry , but all other steel companies opposed the introduction of anti-dumping measures .
Overall , user companies accounted for around 38 % of the Community consumption of Magnesia -@ Steinen .
5.2 Highly sensitive goods
( 135 ) Refractory materials are of the utmost strategic importance for the steel industry .
the entire steel passes through converters , ovens and pans with Magnesia -@ bricks walled out converters , ovens and pans .
Supply difficulties could therefore have significant consequences in the form of production interruptions , repairs or security problems .
For this reason , stones of high quality , i.e. long service life , and good technical support for this type of product are very important .
Due to the high technical requirements , a lot of time , high investments and research are required for the establishment of a supply relationship .
also the switch from one Chinese manufacturer to another manufacturer would also be very difficult .
the steel producers claimed that they had made good progress with Chinese manufacturers and their importers in the Community , mainly by improving efficiency and innovation , they have made good progress with Chinese manufacturers and their importers in the Community over the last two years , mainly by improving efficiency and innovation .
( 136 ) Companies objected to the introduction of measures therefore fear that there may be bottlenecks in the supply of high-quality stones and adequate technical assistance .
they fear that Chinese manufacturers would withdraw from the Community market in the event of the introduction of measures .
besides , the largest occurrences of magnesite , the most important raw material for Magnesia -@ stones , are located in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
The steel industry is therefore afraid that its relations with Chinese commodity suppliers could deteriorate .
( 137 ) However , as already stated above , the anti-dumping measures are not aimed at preventing the import of the goods concerned or to make the activity of steel producers .
This means that non-harmful imports could continue to be imported into the Community .
As a result , existing relations with Chinese exporters could be maintained even if anti-dumping measures were introduced against dumped imports .
This is also supported by the fact that the goods concerned have only such an insignificant share of the total production costs of steel producers , that measures would have only a minor impact on the expense of users ( cf . Recital 142 ) .
( 138 ) It should also be borne in mind that the goods concerned are of strategic importance to the steel industry .
in the event of a waiver of measures , there is a risk that the entire production of the goods concerned will be transferred to the People &apos;s Republic of China in the long term .
Given that there are no major manufacturers in other third countries , such a dependence on Chinese imports is clearly not a viable scenario for the steel industry
( 139 ) In addition , there is no evidence that the access of the raw materials of the steel producers who produce Magnesia -@ stones for their own use could be made more difficult .
5.3 Market structure
( 140 ) The user industry claimed that the measures would strengthen a market structure with a few large manufacturers .
the users argued that this lack of competition was the result of mergers and acquisitions in the fire festival -@ industry in the 90s .
( 141 ) The largest manufacturer in the Community had a market share of around 30 % in the UZ , which should hardly be sufficient to control and control the market .
This is underpinned by the fact that this market share declined as a result of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
as stated above , these imports will in all likelihood continue even after the introduction of measures .
besides , many small businesses in the community and even some steel companies themselves produce Magnesia -@ stones , and during the investigation no evidence was presented that the major manufacturers in the community dominated the market in the claimed way .
as no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour has been presented , the claim remains unfounded and unproven .
5.4 Higher costs
( 142 ) The steel industry also argued that anti-dumping duties on Magnesia -@ stones would incur additional costs on the highly price-sensitive steel market and , above all , in competition with steel producers from third countries .
For this reason , anti-dumping duties would affect the competitiveness of the steel industry , especially since the pressure on the markets for other raw materials for steel products is also very strong .
( 143 ) Nevertheless , the responses of the user industry to the questionnaire show that the Magnesia -@ stones are well below 1 % of the total cost .
Consequently , the proposed anti-dumping duties would only have a marginal impact on the total cost of steel production .
the latest developments in the steel industry clearly show a recovery in selling prices and profitability , further reducing the share of Magnesia -@ stones in total sales turnover .
5.5 Conclusion on the interest of users
( 144 ) In view of the foregoing , it is unlikely that the anti-dumping measures on the Community market would cut supply or affect competition , especially as China &amp; apos ; Magnesia -@ stones are expected to continue to maintain their market share .
the increase in costs would be only marginal and would not significantly affect the competitiveness of the steel industry .
For these reasons , it is provisionally considered that the interests of users do not oppose the introduction of measures .
6 . Conclusion on the interest of the Community
( 145 ) The introduction of measures against imports of Magnesia -@ bricks originating in the country concerned would be clearly in the interests of the Community industry .
As far as importers / traders and user industries are concerned , any impact on the prices of the Magnesia -@ stones should be minor .
By contrast , the loss of market share and profitability in the Community sector and the fall in its prices , on the other hand , are clearly larger .
( 146 ) In view of the foregoing , it is provisionally concluded that there are no compelling reasons against the introduction of anti-dumping duties on imports of Magnesia -@ stones originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
F. ANTIDUMPINGMASSNURES
1 . Damage repair threshold
( 147 ) In view of the conclusions on dumping , damage and Community interest , measures should be introduced to prevent further damage to the Community industry by dumped imports .
( 148 ) Customs shall be set at a level sufficient to eliminate the damage caused by such imports without exceeding the established dumping margin .
In determining the duty rate required to eliminate the effects of harmful dumping , it was assumed that any measures should enable the Community industry to cover its production costs and , as a whole , to achieve an appropriate pre-tax profit , which could be achieved by an sector of this kind in the sector under normal conditions of competition , i.e. without dumped imports , when selling similar goods in the Community .
This calculation was based on a pre-tax profit margin of 8 % of sales was used on the basis of the profit margins before the occurrence of dumped imports .
On this basis , a non-damaging price of the similar goods was determined for the Community industry .
the non-damaging price was determined on the basis of the production costs plus the aforementioned profit margin of 8 % .
( 149 ) The necessary price increase was then determined by comparing the weighted average import price with the non-damaging price .
Import prices were corrected by 10 % upwards for three reasons .
Firstly , the production facilities of the Community industry were located near the steel mills , while the cost of transporting from the import port and the insurance costs for imports were generally higher .
Secondly , the price charged by the Community industry to the respective steel mills for sale also included technical assistance , which was usually not the case with the exporters .
Thirdly , all sales of the Community industry were at the level of end consumers , while many import business were at the level of traders , which had additional costs .
( 150 ) Any differences arising in the settlement have been expressed as a percentage of the average cif -@ import value .
the comparison was made on the basis of the product groups formed according to PCN -@ numbers ( cf . Recital 11 ) .
( 151 ) The provisional weighed damage margins for companies granted either individual treatment or market economy status amounted to :
- Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 17.1 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 42.1 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Kyushu Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 21.9 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Guangyang Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 21.9 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Qinghua Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 54.6 % _ BAR _
- Dashiqiao Sanqiang Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 66.1 % . _ BAR _
( 152 ) In connection with the calculation of the nationwide compensation threshold for all other exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China , it should be borne in mind that the cooperation was low .
for this reason , a range was calculated on the basis of the data of those cooperating exporters to whom neither MWB nor IB was granted .
as this damage threshold was lower than the highest margin of damage in the case of the companies listed above , and in order not to reward the non-cooperation , the nationwide damage margin was set at the level of the highest range found above , i.e. 66.1 % .
2 . Preliminary measures
( 153 ) On the basis of the foregoing , it was held that , in accordance with Article 7 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation , provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
in accordance with the lower duty rule , anti-dumping duties should be set in the amount of the dumping or damage margin , depending on which of the two is lower .
since the cooperation was low , the residual range should be set in the amount of the highest for the cooperating manufacturers , i.e. in the amount of 66.1 % of the cif -@ price free limit of the community , should be determined unpaid .
the company-specific anti-dumping duty rates set out in this Regulation have been set on the basis of the findings of this investigation .
they thus reflect the situation of companies during this investigation .
In contrast to the nationwide customs duties for &quot; all other undertakings &quot; , these tariffs therefore apply exclusively to imports of the goods originating in the country concerned and are manufactured by the legal entities named by name .
Goods imported by other companies not mentioned by name and address in the available part of this decision , including the companies expressly affiliated with the expressly mentioned undertakings , are not subject to these individual customs duties , but to the customs applicable to &quot; all other companies &quot; .

of 12 April 2005
amending Regulation ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 on the preparation of a nomenclature of agricultural products for export refunds and Regulation ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 having specific implementing provisions to Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 804 / 68 with regard to export licences and export refunds in the milk and dairy products sector
the COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY COMMISSION ,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and dairy products &#91; 1 &#93; , in particular Article 31 ( 14 ) ,
Whereas :
( 1 ) Commission Regulation ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 &#91; 2 &#93; established the nomenclature of agricultural products for export refunds .
( 2 ) According to the reimbursement nomenclature , cheese shall be eligible for export refund if they meet minimum requirements for dry milk and milk fat .
a type of cheese produced in certain new Member States could meet these requirements , but not benefit from a refund because it is not covered by the current classification system of the export refund nomenclature .
Due to the importance of this cheese for the dairy industry , the trade and the respective milk producers , it is appropriate to add a product code under the heading &quot; other cheeses &quot; , so that the cheese can be classified in the export refunds nomenclature .
( 3 ) The quantities for which export licences are requested in the product category &apos; cheese &apos; shall constantly exceed the profile of the export restrictions applicable to the Community in accordance with the Convention on Agriculture concluded under the multilateral trade negotiations of the Uruguay Round .
the additional export licences requested under the newly created position will increase the pressure on this category .

However , this provision does not apply to cheese of code 0406 90 33 9919 of the nomenclature of the export refunds .
In these circumstances , in view of the numerous requests for the granance of export licences for cheese , it is appropriate to apply this provision to all types of cheeses without exception .
( 5 ) In accordance with the footnote 10 applicable to grated cheese , cheese in powder form and processed cheese in Annex I Sector 9 to Regulation ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 , non-milk ingredients shall not be taken into account when calculating the reimbursement .
This determination is to be extended to all types of cheeses and the relevant non-milk ingredients must be described in more detail .
It may be very difficult or even impossible for the exporter and even more for the competent authority , it may be very difficult or even impossible to determine the weight of these components .
therefore , it is advisable to reduce the refund by a standard amount .
( 6 ) The refund shall be granted for the net weight of the cheese .
in cases where the cheese is enveloped in paraffin , ash or wax or wrapped in plastic wrap , there may be uncertainfusion .
it must be provided that such an enclosure is not part of the net weight of the product for the purpose of calculating the refund .
in the case of plastic foil , paraffin and ash , it may be impossible for the exporter and the competent authority to determine the weight of these materials .
therefore , it is advisable to reduce the refund by a standard amount .
( 7 ) Regulations ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 and ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 shall be amended accordingly .
( 8 ) The measures provided for in this Regulation shall comply with the opinion of the Management Committee on Milk and Dairy Products ,

Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 559 / 2005
of 12 April 2005
to initiate an investigation into the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures introduced by Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2074 / 2004 in -à-vis imports of certain ring binder mechanics originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China through imports of certain ring binder mechanisms sent from the Democratic People &amp; apos ; Republic of Laos , whether notified as a certificate of origin of the Democratic People &amp; apos ; s Republic of Laos , and on the customs recording of the latter imports
the COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY COMMISSION ,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 384 / 96 of 22 December 1995 on the protection against dumped imports from countries not belonging to the European Community &#91; 1 &#93; ( hereinafter referred to as the &quot; Basic Regulation &quot; ) , in particular Articles 13 ( 3 ) , Article 14 ( 3 ) and Article 14 ( 5 ) ,
after consulting the Advisory Committee ,
Whereas :
A. ANTRAG
( 1 ) The Commission received an application under Article 13 ( 3 ) of the basic Regulation to investigate the alleged circumvention of anti-dumping measures against imports of certain ring binder mechanics originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China ( hereinafter referred to as the &quot; People &apos;s Republic of China &quot; ) .
( 2 ) The application was submitted on 28 February 2005 by Ring Alliance Ringbuchtechnik GmbH on behalf of joint manufacturers , which account for more than 70 % of the joint production of certain ring binder mechanics .
B. WARE
( 3 ) The goods affected by the alleged bypass are certain ring binder mechanics normally assigned to the KN -@ Code ex83051000 , originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
this KN to -@ code is only specified for information purposes .
( 4 ) The goods , which are the subject of the investigation are certain ring binder mechanics sent from the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; examined goods &quot; ) and which are normally assigned to the same KN -@ code as the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
C. YEEVY MEASURES
( 5 ) The measures currently in force and possibly circumvented are a final anti-dumping duty introduced by Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2074 / 2004 &#91; 2 &#93; , which has been extended to imports of the same goods sent from Vietnam &#91; 3 &#93; .
d . GREEN FOR SUPPORT
( 6 ) The application shall contain sufficient evidence that the anti-dumping measures originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China will be circumvented by reloading the goods examined in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos and / or their montage in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos .
the following evidence has been provided :
- According to the request , the trade structure has changed significantly as a result of a significant increase in imports of the goods examined , while imports of the goods concerned , originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China , declined after the introduction of measures , for which , apart from the introduction of customs , there is no sufficient justification or justification .
- This change in the trade structure seems to be due to the transhipment of certain ring binder mechanics originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China to the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos and / or the montage of certain ring binder mechanics in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos .
- In addition , the request contains sufficient evidence to undermine the remedy effect of the anti-dumping measures originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China , will be undermined both in terms of quantity and prices .
Apparently that significant quantities of imports of certain ring binder mechanics from the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos have taken the place of imports of the goods concerned , originating from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
- In addition , there is sufficient evidence that the goods examined will be sold at prices dumped compared to the normal value originally determined for certain ring binder mechanics originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
- Should , in addition to the dispatch via the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos , other bypass practices within the meaning of Article 13 of the Basic Regulation in the course of the investigation in addition to the dispatch via the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos , the investigation may also extend to these practices .
E. PROCEDURE
7 . For the above reasons , the Commission has concluded that the evidence is sufficient to justify the initiation of an investigation under Article 13 of the Basic Regulation and to record the imports of certain ring binder mechanics sent from the Democratic People &amp; apos ; Democratic Republic of Laos , irrespective of whether or not their origin is indicated in the application with the Democratic People &amp; apos ; Democratic Republic of Laos , in accordance with Article 14 ( 5 ) of the Basic Regulation .

the Commission may also consult interested parties if the parties request for this in writing and prove that there are specific reasons for their hearing .
( c ) Exemption from customs collection of imports or measures
( 12 ) As the alleged circumvention takes place outside the Community , in accordance with Article 13 ( 4 ) of the Basic Regulation , manufacturers of the goods concerned which may prove that they are not connected to a manufacturer subject to the existing measures and for which it has been established that they are not involved in the circumvention practices within the meaning of Article 13 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation may be exempt from the customs collection of imports or from the measures .
Manufacturers wishing to obtain an exemption should submit an application within the time limit set in Article 3 ( 3 ) .
F. COMPUSITD RELEDING

for reasons of clarity , it is therefore advisable to repeal Regulation ( EC ) No 1498 / 1999 and replace it with a new regulation .
( 2 ) For the assessment of production and the market in the milk and dairy products sector , regular communications on the functioning of the intervention measures provided for in Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 and , in particular , on the development of the inventories of the products concerned at the intervention sites or in private camps .
( 3 ) The fixing of aid for skimmed milk processed into casein and refunds is only possible on the basis of communications on the development of domestic and world market prices .
4 . Accurate and regular monitoring of trade flows , which may be used to assess the impact of refunds shall require information on the exports of the products for which reimbursements , in particular as regards the quantities for which the contract is awarded in the context of a tender .
5 . In order to respect the obligations arising from the Convention on Agriculture Convention &quot; , adopted in the context of the multilateral trade negotiations of the Uruguay -@ Round and approved by Council Decision 94 / 800 / EC &#91; 3 &#93; ( hereinafter referred to as &apos; Convention on Agriculture &apos; ) , additional and more detailed information on import and export shall be required , in particular on the application for licences and their use .
for the best possible use , rapid information on the development of exports is necessary for the best possible use .
Under the same Convention , exports under food aid are not subject to the constraints applicable to subsidised exports .
Therefore , the notifications on export licence applications must be distinguished as to whether these are notifications of licences requested for food aid deliveries .
( 6 ) Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 of 26 January 1999 has specific implementing provisions to Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 804 / 68 with regard to export licences and export refunds in the milk and dairy products sector &#91; 4 &#93; contains specific provisions for the export of certain dairy products to Canada , the United States and the Dominican Republic .
therefore , the transmission of the relevant information must be provided .

therefore , the transmission of the relevant information must be provided .
( 8 ) Pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 , in certain cases an export license may also apply to a product code other than the code specified in Section 16 of the export license .
therefore , the transmission of the relevant information must be provided .
( 9 ) In accordance with Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 2535 / 2001 of 14 December 2001 with implementing provisions of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 on the import regime for milk and dairy products and the opening of the tariff quotas in question &#91; 5 &#93; , certificates IMA 1 shall be issued by the competent authorities in third countries in order to manage certain import quotas .
Member States shall notify the Commission of the product quantities for which import licences are granted on the basis of IMA 1 certificates .
Experience has shown that these reports do not always make it possible to closely monitor the progress of imports in its individual phases .
therefore , the transmission of additional information must be provided .
( 10 ) The experience gained over the years in the evaluation of the information transmitted have shown that this information is often transmitted too often .
therefore , the frequency of certain communications must be reduced .
( 11 ) It is essential to be able to compare price quotes for products , in particular for the purpose of calculating refunds and amounts of state aid .
In addition , the plausibility of these price quotations must be set out by weighting the information .
( 12 ) The means of communication have developed a lot in recent years .
this development must be taken into account in order to make communications faster , more efficient and safer .
( 13 ) The measures provided for in this Regulation shall be in line with the opinion of the Management Committee on Milk and Dairy Products ,

Council Regulation ( EC ) No 564 / 2005
of 8 April 2005
to reamend Regulation No 1601 / 2001 establishing a definitive anti-dumping duty and for the final appropriation of the provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain iron or steel cables and ropes originating in the Czech Republic , Russia , Thailand and Turkey
the COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 384 / 96 of 22 December 1995 on the protection against dumped imports from countries not belonging to the European Community &#91; 1 &#93; ( hereinafter referred to as the &quot; Basic Regulation &quot; ) , in particular Article 11 ( 3 ) ,
on a proposal from the Commission after consultations in the Advisory Committee ,
Whereas :
A. PREOANAL PROCEDURE
( 1 ) On 5 May 2000 , the Commission opened an anti-dumping procedure &#91; 2 &#93; concerning the imports of certain cables and ropes made of iron or steel originating in Turkey , inter others .
( 2 ) This procedure ultimately led to the introduction of a definitive anti-dumping duty under Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 &#91; 3 &#93; in order to eliminate the harmful effects of dumping .
B. ANTRAG ON the INTRODUCTION of an INTERIM REVIEW
( 3 ) Has Çelik ve Halat Sanayi Ticaret A.S. ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; Has Çelik &quot; or &quot; applicant &quot; ) , a Turkish executive manufacturer of certain cables and ropes made of iron or steel cables and ropes made of iron or steel subject to the applicable anti-dumping measures , applied for a partial interim review of Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 .
( 4 ) This request , in accordance with Article 11 ( 3 ) of the Basic Regulation , it was argued that the circumstances relating to dumping on the basis of which the existing measures were introduced have changed and that these changes are permanent .
( 5 ) According to the application , the applicant has made structural changes which had a significant impact on the normal value .
In addition , the applicant argued that a comparison of the normal value based on his expense or domestic prices with export prices to the Community would result in a dumping margin significantly below the anti-dumping duty of 17.8 % applicable to imports .
Therefore , maintaining the measures at their current level , which are based on the previously determined dumping margin , is no longer necessary to compensate for dumping .
( 6 ) After consultations in the Advisory Committee , the Commission concluded that there was sufficient evidence to justify the opening of a partial interim review , so that it published a corresponding notice &#91; 4 &#93; and began an investigation limited to determining the existence of dumping to the applicant .
C. PROCEDURE
( 7 ) The Commission shall formally informed the representatives of the export country and the applicant of the opening of the partial interim review and gave all parties directly concerned the opportunity to present their position in writing and to request for a hearing .
the Liaison Committee of the European Foundation of the Wire Rope Industries ( EWRIS ( the applicant in the previous proceedings ) sent an opinion .
( 8 ) The Commission also sent a questionnaire to the applicant , which the questionnaire within the deadline set in the announcement .
( 9 ) The Commission consulup with all the information deemed necessary for dumping investigation , examined it and made a inspection visit to the applicant &amp; apos ; s company .
( 10 ) The dumping investigation concerned the period from 1 July 2003 to 29 February 2004 ( hereinafter referred to as the &quot; investigation period &quot; ) .
d . WARE
affected goods
similar goods
( 12 ) Like the previous investigation , the review also showed that the SWR produced by the applicant in Turkey and sells or carries out into the Community has the same fundamental material characteristics and uses , so that they are to be regarded as similar goods within the meaning of Article 1 ( 4 ) of the Basic Regulation .
E. DUMPING
Normal value
( 13 ) In the course of determining the normal value , it was first examined whether the domestic sales of the similar goods carried out by the applicant were representative compared to his export sales to the Community .
This was the case , since , in accordance with Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation , corresponded to at least 5 % of its total export sales to the Community in accordance with Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation .
( 14 ) Subsequently , for each of the types sold by the applicant on the domestic market , which , according to the results of the investigation were directly comparable to those exported to the Community , it was then investigated whether the domestic sales were sufficiently representative within the meaning of Article 2 ( 2 ) of the basic regulation .
this was considered given if the total amount of domestic sales of a type during the period under investigation was at least 5 % of the total volume of export sales of the same type to the Community during the period under investigation .
for most of the types exported to the Community during the period under investigation , a comparable type sold in representative quantities on the domestic market could be determined .
( 15 ) For the types of goods that reached the 5 % threshold , it was then checked in each case whether domestic sales could be regarded as transactions in normal trade by determining the share of profitable sales to independent customers .
In all cases , more than 80 % of the total domestic sales of the respective type were profitable , so the normal value was based on the weighted average of all domestic sales during the investigation period .
( 16 ) For the types exported in the Community for which , according to the results of the investigation , no comparable types were sold on the domestic market , the normal value of Article 2 paragraphs 3 and ( 6 ) of the Basic Regulation was determined on the basis of the applicant &apos;s production costs for the types in question , plus an appropriate amount for selling , administrative and overhead costs ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; VG -@ costs &quot; ) and for profits .
the VG -@ costs was based on those recorded by the applicant for domestic sales of the similar goods .
the profit margin was based on those achieved by the applicant for domestic sales of similar goods in normal trade .
Export price
( 17 ) As all exports of the goods concerned were sold directly to independent customers in the Community , the export price was determined in accordance with Article 2 ( 8 ) of the Basic Regulation on the basis of the prices actually paid or to be paid .
Comparison
( 18 ) The comparison of the normal value with the export price was carried out at the level ex works and at the same trading level .
in the interest of a fair settlement , corrections were made on request in accordance with Article 2 ( 10 ) of the Basic Regulation for demonstrably differences in the factors of transport costs , insurance costs , provision , loading and ancillary costs , borrowing costs and commissions .
Dumping span
( 19 ) Pursuant to Article 2 ( 11 ) of the Basic Regulation , in order to determine the dumping margin for each type of product , the weighted average corrected normal value was compared with the weighted average net export price ex works of the comparable type of goods in order to determine the dumping margin for each type of product .
( 20 ) This comparison showed that there was no dumping .
F. DAUERHAFTE CHANGE OF THE ENVIROENTS
( 21 ) In accordance with Article 11 ( 3 ) of the Basic Regulation , it was also examined whether it was reasonably assumed that the circumstances had changed permanently .
( 22 ) In this respect , the investigation showed that the applicant made structural changes with a significant impact on production and organization , which resulted in a significantly higher production efficiency and thus a reduction in production costs , so that the normal value was lower compared to that in the period under investigation of the previous survey ( 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000 ) .
in the same period , export prices have risen during the same period and the investigation showed no evidence that this increase was only temporary .
( 23 ) It is therefore concluded that circumstances have changed permanently , in particular to the increase in the price of exports to the Community and the simultaneous reduction in production costs .
g . ANTIDUMPINGMASSNURES
( 24 ) As no dumping has been established , the measures should be lifted vis-à-vis the applicant .
( 25 ) The interested parties have been informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which an amendment to Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 should be recommended and were given the opportunity to comment .
( 26 ) As a result , the ERIS sent some general comments , which mainly concerned the rising commodity prices after the period under investigation .
the EWRIS did not call into question the above dumping findings , but expressed concern that the applicant might be able to practise dumping again .
( 27 ) At the commodity prices , it should be noted that although they may have risen after the period under investigation , this could not be taken into account in the dumping investigation for the applicant .
In the present case , the most important raw material is wire rod , a simple steel product whose prices usually fluctuate rapidly .
Therefore , an increase in the prices of such a commodity cannot be seen as a permanent change , which could invalidate the above findings .
( 28 ) Finally , it should be noted that the measures will only be repeted only for the applicant and not for Turkey as a whole , so that , in accordance with Article 11 ( 6 ) of the basic regulation , the applicants will continue to be included in the procedure and can be re-examined in the context of a subsequent review carried out for Turkey .

amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 adopting commitments relating to the anti-dumping procedure concerning imports of potassium chloride originating in the Republic of Belarus , the Russian Federation and Ukraine
the COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY COMMISSION ,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 384 / 96 of 22 December 1995 on the protection against dumped imports from countries not belonging to the European Community &#91; 1 &#93; ( hereinafter referred to as the &apos; Basic Regulation &quot; ) , in particular Article 8 ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 992 / 2004 of 17 May 2004 amending Regulation ( EEC ) No 3068 / 92 establishing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of potassium chloride originating in Belarus , Russia and Ukraine &#91; 2 &#93; , in particular Article 1 ,
after consultations in the Advisory Committee ,
Whereas :
( 1 ) With Regulation ( EEC ) No 3068 / 92 &#91; 3 &#93; , the Council introduced a final anti-dumping duty on imports of potassium chloride originating in the Russian Federation ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; Russia &quot; ) .
By Regulation ( EC ) No 969 / 2000 &#91; 4 &#93; , the Council amended the measures originally introduced by Regulation ( EEC ) No 3068 / 92 to imports of potassium chloride originating in measures introduced , inter alia , Russia and extended their validity .
( 2 ) In March 2004 , by way of a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union &#91; 5 &#93; , opened a partial interim review of the measures against imports of potassium chloride originating in Russia , among others , in order to examine whether the measures had to be amended as a result of the enlargement of the European Union to 25 Member States ( hereinafter referred to as &apos; enlargement &apos; ) as a result of the enlargement of the European Union .
( 3 ) According to the results of the partial interim review , a temporary adaptation of the existing measures was in the interest of the Community in order to prevent sudden and excessively negative effects on importers and users in the ten new Member States of the European Union ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; EU -@ 10 &quot; ) immediately after enlargement .
4 . Regulation ( EC ) No 992 / 2004 , the Council authorised the Commission to adopt commitments which meet the conditions laid down in paragraphs 27 to 32 of that Regulation .
On this basis , in accordance with Article 8 , Article 11 ( 3 ) , Article 21 and Article 22 ( c ) of the basic Regulation on Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 &#91; 6 &#93; .
( 5 ) In the case of an executive producer , the Commission adopted a joint commitment for imports of potassium chloride sold to the Community by JSC Uralkali , Berezniki , Russia and sold exclusively by the distribution company Fertexim Ltd , Limassol , Cyprus .
( 6 ) JSC Uralkali informed the Commission that it would henceforth process its sales to the Community through another company called Uralkali Trading SA , Geneva , Switzerland .
JSC Uralkali and Fertexim Ltd requested a corresponding amendment to Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 on the adoption of the joint commitment offer .
To this end , JSC Uralkali and Uralkali Trading SA have jointly submitted a revised commitment offer .
( 7 ) JSC Uralkali also pointed out that , within the framework of the obligation adopted by Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 did not allow direct sales of JSC Uralkali to independent customers in the Community had not been possible under the obligation adopted by Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 .
In the revised commitment , JSC Uralkali also undertakes to comply with its conditions for direct sales to the Community .
( 8 ) The Commission examined the commitment .
it concluded that the revised commitment met all the conditions laid down in Regulation ( EC ) No 992 / 2004 , namely that ( i ) the sales prices are set at a level that effectively contributes to the elimination of the damage , ( ii ) that the companies essentially comply with certain quantities of imports for sales to customers in the EU -@ 10 and ( iii ) they also essentially maintain their traditional sales designs vis-à-vis individual customers in the EU--@ 10 .
Furthermore , it was concluded that , as asserted by JSC Uralkali , the transfer of Fertexim Ltd &apos;s sales activities to Uralkali Trading SA did not affect the effectiveness of the obligation or the information provided by the companies whose effective monitoring .
( 9 ) JSC Uralkali &amp; apos ; s request for the exemption of its direct sales to the Community from anti-dumping duties was considered acceptable as it complies with the usual procedure to accept proper commitments from manufacturers operating directly to the Community .
( 10 ) In the light of the foregoing , it was deemed necessary to amend the existing part of Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 accordingly ,
has FOLLOING REGULATION :
Article 1
Article 1 of Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 is replaced by the following :
