Introduction
Anjuta is a versatile integrated development environment ( IDE ) for the GNOME -@ desktop , providing a variety of advanced development methods such as project management , program wizard , an interactive debugger , the interface designer Glade , the API -@ Help Devhelp , the memory -@ Profiler Valgrind , the performance -@ Profiler gprof , a class generator , a powerful source editor , source code -@ browser and more .
in the following screenshot you will see some of what you will encounter in Anjuta .
Please report any problems you encounter when using Anjuta - this helps to improve the software as well as the Open -@ Source -@ community .
first steps with Anjuta
Menus and key combinations
at the top of the Anjuta -@ main window is the menu bar . It allows almost the entire functionality of Anjuta can be accessed by menu items . Actions were assigned depending on the type , for example , file operations , for example , can be found in the file -@ menu .
Menu bar
Anjuta and -@ menu bar
&quot; File &quot; menu
Key combinations are available for many menu items . All key combinations are displayed next to the assigned menu item . Some more helpful key combinations are listed here .
Change editor page : Ctrl AltImage ↑ ( forward ) and Ctrl-AltImage ↓ ( backward ) . You can also switch pages by right-clicking on the tab and selecting a filename from the pop-up menu ( this is useful if all tab are not immediately visible ) . Some working environments may have assigned these key combinations , in which case you will need to occupy them differently ( not in Anjuta ) if you want to use them in Anjuta .
Contextual Help : Shift F1 . Move the input mark over the word ( e.g. a function name ) for which you want to call the API -@ Help and use this key combination . Context help only works if Devhelp is installed ; Otherwise , the Context Help menu and the button on the toolbar are disabled . You can obtain Devhelp from the Devhelp -@ website , and you must also install the associated Devhelp -@ books .
Automatic completion : Ctrl Enter . Position the input mark exactly behind an incomplete word and use this key combination . A list of possible completfications is displayed to it . You can scroll through the list to search for and select the desired addition .
further key combinations : look for key combinations that are displayed to the right of the menu entries .
Adjust keyboard shortcuts
Key combinations can be changed under Edit Settings in the Shortcut tab .
Main window
The main window contains several viewports that can be rearranged by dragging their respective title bar , which can also be minimized by pressing the button on the left of their title bar .
The document window has only one document active ( when files are open ) . All file commands affect the active document . You can switch to any opened document by clicking on the respective tab . You can also do the same by right-clicking on any tab and select the desired document from the appearing pop-up window , especially when many files are open but not all associated file tabs are visible .
the project window contains the tree of the project files when a project is open , otherwise the project window is usually hidden . Double-clicking on any object in the project window opens this file .
the file window contains a file tree . If no project is open , the file tree usually shows the top folder of the file system , but this can be adjusted in the settings . When a project is opened , all files of the project are displayed in the window . Double-clicking on a file opens it with the corresponding application , as specified in the GNOME MIME -@ settings . A right-click opens a context menu that offers you further ways to open the file .
The symbol window shows a tree of the available symbols in the project , which is formed by processing the ctags , and a double click opens an editor window with the respective file in the corresponding line .
there is also a search tab in the icon window where you can search for symbols .
the message window displays all outputs ( both stdout and stderr ) when an external command is executed . The message window is usually hidden , but is displayed when external commands are executed , such as compiling a file or project , error analysis , search , and many other operations .
Messages in the preset foreground color ( usually black ) are normal messages . Orange messages are warnings , and red represent errors . Warnings and error messages are linked : a double click on such a message opens the corresponding file in the respective line number .
For example , if you compile a file that contains errors , red messages will explain the problems and indicate the error location , double-clicking on such a message will open the file and highlight the line with the error .
the terminal window is a terminal -@ emulator in which you can enter commands as in the GNOME .
Session management
All settings , including window sizes and positions , are saved when Anjuta is closed . A session management is still in development , so you should not terminate Anjuta with unsaved documents . Anjuta will warn you if you want to quit while unsaved documents are still open .
File operations
create a new file and insert text
create a new file
To create a new file , select File New in the menu bar , or click the New File button on the toolbar . A new page will appear in the editor ( or a new window if the parent document ? ) . New documents will be named New File 1 , New File 2 , New File 3 , etc .
Save a file
You should save new documents as soon as possible to avoid data loss due to crashes .
File next -@ Assistant
File Creation Wizard
the &quot; Open File &quot; dialog
a wizard can also be used to create a new file by selecting File New File from the menu bar . The New File dialog opens . Select the file type and enter the file name . The extension will be added automatically . You can add license information and a file header . In case of a C / C + header file , you can also add a header template . Click OK to confirm the creation .
Anjuta occasionally creates new file windows during some operations . For example , some Subversion -@ operations such as Diff and Protocol create new file windows and output the output there . You can save the contents of these windows to files if necessary .
insert macros
You can use macros to quickly edit repetitive text passages .
the macro like -@ plugin must be activated .
insert
There are two types of macros : Anjuta -@ macros and users -@ macros ( they are displayed as &quot; My macros &quot; ) .Anjuta -@ macros can not be changed , but you can create and edit user -@ macros .
To insert a macro , position the input mark in the desired location . Select Edit Macro Macros .... A dialog will open . Select the desired macro from the list . The result of the macro -@ implementation is displayed in the window and a summary will be displayed in the dialog window . Select Insert . The implemented macro text will be inserted at the current position of the input mark .
Macro
the macro and -@ dialog
another way to insert macros is to select Edit Macro Macro ... , and then press the desired macro -@ key combination .
defining macros
In the Insert Macro window , select Add or select Edit Macro Macro ... . then the &quot; Add / Edit . &quot; window , enter the name of the macro , select or define a category , and set a key combination . Then edit text relative to your macro . The character &quot; _ BAR _ &quot; indicates the position of the input mark after the macro has been executed . Click OK . the macro will be added to the list .
You can also delete a macro by selecting and removing it , which is of course only possible with user -@ macros ( &quot; My Macros &quot; ) .
Add / edit macro
Add / edit dialog
Similarly , you can edit and change a macro by selecting it from the list and selecting Edit .
Macro file -@ Keywords
Macro -@ keywords are available . You can be included in macro -@ definitions . Start macro -@ keywords begin and end with the sign &quot; @ . &quot;
Keyword -@ macro
the keyword like -@ macro
available macro for -@ keywords are @ DATE _ TIME @ , @ DATE _ YMD @ , @ DATE _ Y @ , @ USER _ NAME @ , @ FILE _ NAME @ , @ FILE _ NAME _ UP @ , @ FILE _ NAME _ UP _ PREFIX @ , @ EMAIL @ , @ TABSIZE @ , @ INDENTSIZE @ , and @ USETABS @ .
open and save files
Dialog to open files
Open a file : to open an existing file , select Open file from the menu bar and click the Open button , or use the key combination CtrgO . This will open the Open File dialog . Enter or select the name of the file you want to open . Then click Open . To open multiple files at once , you can select several one by one by holding down the Ctrl ; then click Open . if you have changed your mind , you can press Cancel to close the dialog without opening a file .
Dialog to open multiple files
the dialog &quot; Open File &quot; dialog in multi-file mode
You can enable the Show Hidden Files setting in the pop-up window , which appears in the File Open dialog after a right-click . With this setting , hidden files ( their name starts with . &quot; ) visible in the file list . Remove this setting back so as not to display hidden files . The dialog for opening files also has a built-in type filter . Select the appropriate file type filter in the dialog , and the file list is limited to files of the selected type .
Save as a file
To save a file : To save a file , select Save from the menu bar and click the Save button on the toolbar , or press Ctrl . If the file is new , the Save As dialog opens , enter a file name and click Save to save the new file under the specified name .
automatic saving of a file
If automatic saving is activated , Anjuta does not automatically save new files . You must first save them yourself . The same applies to the Save All setting : Anjuta does not save new files as long as you have not yet saved them yourself . You must first save a file yourself before automatically saving or storing all works with them .
Among other things , save a file under another name : You can explicitly save a file under a new name . To do this , selecting Save As from the menu bar . The Save File As dialog opens and asks for the new file name . Enter the name and click Save .
Overwrite file when saving
If you use Save As with an existing file , the original will not be deleted . It remains unchanged since the last saving . If a file with the new file name already exists , a confirmation dialog will be displayed to make sure you want to overwrite it . By clicking Yes , the file will be overwritten with the one you save .
Close a file : To close a file , select File Close from the menu bar to close a file , or click on the Close button on the toolbar ( you can also close a file by clicking on the cross ( &quot; X &quot; ) in the tab for the file name . ) , so the current file will be closed . If the file is new or not , Anjuta will ask whether the file should be saved before closing .
edit files
Anjuta has a number of features to help you edit source files , and the following sections describe how some of the interesting features are used .
Editor edges
the toolbar for labelling
Editor edges : Editor edges are located to the left of the editor and are used for some specific purposes . There are three editor edges available : the line number border , the marking border and the border for text folds . By default ( that is , at the first start of Anjuta ) , only the border for text folds is visible . The other two can be displayed visible via the AnsichtEditor menu .
The border for line numbers is the largest of all three borders ( and slightly darker than the others ) and specifies the row numbers of a document . The border for row numbers can be displayed or hidden from the View Editor Edge for Line Numbers menu item . A left-click on the border marks an entire line ( including the line break , if available ) , and you can set a font for the line number border in the settings .
If necessary , the text folding border may contain the folding tree . Clicking on nodes in the folding tree folds Code -@ blocks . An underscore is displayed under a folded line to make it clear that a code -@ block has been folded under the line . For more information about folding , read the section Text Folding section below .
hidden marking edge
Editor edges in case of invisible marking edges
If the marker border is not visible , Anjuta displays markers as the background color of a line . For example , if , for example , if a mark of a breakpoint is set for a line and the marker edge is not visible , this line is displayed with a red background . Similarly , the background color will be deep blue or yellow for a bookmark and a line number mark . If you do not like this ( possibly in conjunction with the currently used topic ) , you can turn on the marker edge in the View Editor Marker Edge menu .
Machining aids
Editor with editing aids
Syntax highlighting
Anjuta can highlight the syntax of many different languages , which is usually done automatically by detecting the file type based on the extension . If Anjuta cannot recognize a file type , no syntax highlighting is used . You can explicitly force a highlighting mode by selecting the style from the View Editor Highlight Mode menu .
Anjuta uses a property file called $ prefix / share / anjuta / properties / anjuta.properties , which has the same format as a SciTE -@ property file but does not use all properties . The style of each element for all languages is stored in the $ prefix / share / anjuta / properties / styles.properties file , using some common properties set by Anjuta in the $ home / .config / anjuta / Scintilla / editor boot-@ style.properties .
Text folding
Anjuta can display code -@ folds for source files with languages structured in blocks ( such as C , C + , Pascal , and Java ) . All code -@ blocks in source files can be folded in and out by clicking on the folding points in the border for code -@ Folding of the editor -@ window ( usually a &quot; + / - &quot; symbol or an arrow up / down ) .
Code like -@ Folding is especially useful when editing very large source files with thousands of lines . Once parts are folded , a document seems to be smaller , and easy browsing and editing becomes possible .
Please note that Code -@ folding and editing aids are only available in the Scintilla -@ Editor .
automatic formatting of source code
Anjuta can automatically format C or C + source files or header -@ files ( indent automatically ) . This provides a good overview of the source code , improves readability , reduces the likelihood of syntax errors and above all saves time .
You can search C and C + source files and header files based on tags in the files . a tag ( or icon ) refers to a named entity such as a function definition , structure , or macro . Anjuta scans open C -@ and C + source files and header -@ files for existing tags .
Symbol next -@ Browser
Anjuta automatically searches for tags in all source and header -@ files of an open project . You can jump to any function definition , structure definition , class definition or other tags without opening the corresponding file beforehand . You also do not have to know in which file the tag was found .
Day next -@ Abgleich
You do not have to worry about comparing and updating the tag -@ database . Anjuta does all this , you have to decide which tags you want to start !
Find and replace text in files
Search
To search for a string or a regular expression in the current file , select Edit Find or press Ctrl-AltF .
Enter the string to search in the field and choose whether it is a normal string or a regular expression . You can also set the search direction , case-sensitive attention , and the search area , and click Search to start the search .
In case of successful search , Anjuta starts the search hit or performs another action ( according to the search action you selected in the Search Target tab ) .if the search was unsuccessful , Anjuta will display a message informing about it .
if you want to continue the search , click the Search button again or press Ctrl , so the next search hit will be visited ( use Ctrl for the previous search hit ) . You can change the search text by entering the new string in the Search expression text box in the search dialog .
Dialogue &quot; Search text &quot;
press the Stop button to stop a long search , press the Stop button .
Set the search area
In the Search Target tab , set the search area and the action to be performed in case of a search success .

You can select which action should be performed with successful search .
depending on the previous selection ( search in , search direction , etc . ) , some operations are not available .
Choices for the &quot; Search Tarination &quot; campaign
replace
Find and Replace is similar to the text search , with the difference that you can also enter the replacement text in the Replace with text box , and you can also specify whether you want to be asked before each replacement ( &quot; Replace first hit &quot; and &quot; Replace All Hits &quot; ) .
select Replace to replace the match or Next to go to the next match .
Search settings
You can also save search options .
The object highlighted in red is the active one , the preselected object specifies search settings that are loaded when Anjuta is started .
Search Settings dialog
print a file
Print preview for a C -@ file
Print preview
You can view the print preview with file print preview . the current file is mapped and a print preview is displayed . Source code highlighted in the editor is also highlighted in the preview ( and in the printout ) . The Print tab in the settings of the editor -@ Plugins further settings that allow the expression with line numbers , broken lines and / or headers .
Print settings
If you want to print and are satisfied with the preview , select File Print or Print in the preview window . The print dialog shown below will be opened , select the appropriate print settings and click Print to print the file .
You can also set portrait or landscape , paper size , page orientation , and paper type , do not forget to make the right settings for your printer , otherwise the expression cannot be as expected .
Print dialog
Anjuta has a powerful project management plugin that can open most of the projects based on automake / autoconf , in some unusually configured projects it may fail , but as long as the project uses automake / autoconf in a typical way , it should work .
create a project from a template
To create a new project , select the menu item File New Project ... to start the project -@ wizard . Read the first page carefully .
select the type of application to create on the second page . Click Before to continue .
In the last step , you should check the information you enter .
once the project is created , you can test it and create or run it .
the import process only works if the existing project uses autoconf / automake or , to some extent , a Makefile .
load and save projects
Loading projects
To open a project , select Open File .... Select the project file ( * .anjuta ) in the dialog and click OK .
If a project was recently opened , you will find it in the File Last menu , select the file name of the project from the list , and the project will be opened .
