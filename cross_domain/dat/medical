this document cannot replace the personal conversation with the veterinarian .
If you need more information about the state of health or treatment of your pet , please contact your veterinarian .
For more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations , please refer to the scientific discussion ( which is also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Yarvitan ?
Yarvitan contains the medically effective ingredient mitratapide , which helps to reduce weight in dogs .
Yarvitan is a colorless to slightly yellow solution for entering .
55 -@ ml- or 120 -@ ml -@ bottles for dogs weighing up to 36 kg and a 210 -@ ml -@ bottle for dogs weighing up to 48 kg .
What is Yarvitan used ?
Yarvitan is used as a aid for slimming aid in adult dogs that are overweight or obese ( obese ) .
it is used as part of a program that also includes a restriction on the dog &apos;s food intake .
the drug is administered to the dog for 3 weeks , followed by a 2 -@ week drug break , during which the veterinarian adapts the dog &apos;s diet to his energy needs .
then the dog receives the drug for another 3 weeks in addition to the adapted diet .
The required dose is calculated on weight of a dog , and the Yarvitan -@ solution is given to the animal with feed .
How does Yarvitan work ?
the medically active ingredient in yarvitan , mitratapid , acts in the intestine by blocking a protein ( the microsomal triglyceride -@ transfer protein ) .
this protein is usually involved in the absorption of fats from food .
By blocking the protein , Yarvitan reduces the absorption of fats from the intestine .
due to its mode of action , Yarvitan also has a slight appetizing effect .
how was Yarvitan examined ?
Yarvitan was investigated in dogs in both laboratory tests and in field studies .
two major field studies , one in Europe and one in the US , were carried out on healthy dogs with a body weight that was 20 % above the recommended weight .
about three quarters were given to Yarvitan , while the rest received the drug without the active substance ( control group ) .
the dogs received 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .

Yarvitan reduced the body weight in the recommended dose and using the 3 -@ 2 -@ 3 -@ week treatment plan , yarvitan reduced the body weight in obese dogs compared to the control group .
the weight-reducing effect was relatively moderate ( in the range of 6 -@ 7 % of the body weight before treatment ) .
Treatment is a first measure within the framework of a programme to reduce obesity and must be combined with dietary changes that must be maintained even after the end of treatment .
What are the risks associated with Yarvitan ?
during treatment , vomiting , diarrhea or soft chairs .
In most cases , these side effects are only slightly pronounced and subside without treatment .
also a reduced appetite may also occur during treatment .
this is related to the mode of action of the preparation .
For the full list of side effects reported with Yarvitan can be found in the package leaflet .

this veterinary medicinal product has been specially developed for dogs and is not intended for use in humans .

do not use in bitches during pregnancy and lactation .
3 / 21 4.8 Interactions with other medicines and other interactions
No interactions with other drugs were observed in studies in which yarvitan was administered simultaneously with NSAIDs ( Carprofen , Meloxicam ) or ACE -@ inhibitors ( Enalapril , Benazepril ) .
Interactions with other types of drugs have not been specifically investigated .
the absorption of fat-soluble drugs with simultaneous use with mitratapide was not investigated .
therefore , dogs that receive other medicines in addition to this should be closely monitored with regard to drug interactions .
4.9 Dosage and method of use For input .
the veterinary medicinal product must be administered once a day at a dosage of 0.63 mg mitratapid / kg body weight ( corresponding to 1 ml of the drug per 8 kg ) .
To ensure the correct dosage , the dog should be weighed on day 1 and day 35 ( i.e. at the beginning of each treatment period ) .
the veterinary medicinal product should be administered together with the feed .
use the dosing pipette supplied with the drug for administration .
during the first 21 -@ day treatment , the feed quantity of the animal may remain unchanged .
then the dog should be fed according to its maintenance needs ( this is to be calculated by the veterinarian ) .
this can be achieved either with normal animal feed or with a diet food ( with reduced amount of calories ) .
in clinical trials , the treated animals quickly increased after the end of treatment if the diet was not restricted .
In order to avoid this rapid renewed weight gain ( rebound ) , restrictive feeding must be continued after maintenance needs must be continued after the end of treatment with the drug .
the therapy with Mitratrapid should be limited to one passage of treatment for a dog .
4.10 Overdose ( symptoms , emergency measures , antidotes ) , if necessary
after a 3- or 5 times overdose in dogs , the following symptoms were observed : soft or liquid stool , vomiting , salivation , anorexia , severe weight loss , emaciated appearance , dehydration and pale mucous membranes .
in case of accidental overdose , symptomatic therapy should be carried out .
there is no specific antidote .

5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Mitratapid is a strong inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride -@ transport protein ( MTP ) .
one assumes that
4 / 21 these effects are mediated by the MTP -@ inhibition at the enterocyte level .
this leads to the blocking of lipid absorption from food .
Mitratapide also has a slightly appetizing effect , which is related to its mode of action .
as a result of the accumulation of triglycerides in the enterocytes , appetite may be reduced .
Mitratapid has no central effect .

5.2 Information on pharmacokinetics
Laboratory animals and dogs quickly absorb orally administered mitratapid .
the most important metabolic conversion is sulfoxidation , which produces three active metabolites .
5 l / kg .
Mitratapid and its metabolites bind to a very large extent ( &gt; 99 % ) to plasma proteins and are distributed in the tissues .
the brain is not affected , which is why a central effect of the veterinary medicinal product must be ruled out .
The excretion takes place quickly and predominantly via the feces .
8.5 hours ; the sulphone metabolite reaches 0.0092 µg / ml after 17.5 hours .
at the end of a three-week treatment period , mitratapid reaches average steady -@ state -@ concentrations of 0.0068 µg / ml , the sulfoxide -@ metabolites of 0.0089 µg / ml or
the terminal plasma half-life is 6.3 hours for mitratapid , 9.8 hours or
the pharmacokinetic parameters show a variable dose dependence , and vary slightly between the first and second three-week treatment periods of a complete treatment scheme .

Mr ZACTRAN
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) made the recommendations on the use of the veterinary medicinal product on the basis of the assessment of the documents submitted .
this document cannot replace the personal conversation with the veterinarian .
If you need more information about the state of health or treatment of your pet , please contact your veterinarian .
For more information on the basis of the CVMP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Zactran ?
Zactran is an injection solution for cattle containing the active ingredient gamithromycin ( 150 mg / ml ) .
Who is Zactran used ?
Zactran is an antibiotic .
it is used to treat and prevent respiratory diseases in beef ( Bovine Respiratory Disease ( BRD ) caused by the bacteria Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni .
before the use of Zactran to prevent Germany , the occurrence of the disease should have been detected in the herd .
Zactran is administered as a single subcutaneous injection ( injected under the skin ) .
the dose to be used is calculated based on the weight of the animal to be treated .
Animals weighing more than 250 kg must be administered in more than one place .
How does Zactran work ?
the active ingredient of zactran , gamithromycin , is an antibiotic from the group of macrolides .
It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes , i.e. the parts of the cells in which proteins are produced , thereby inhibiting the growth of the bacteria .
how was Zactran been investigated ?
Appropriate studies have been carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of zactran in cattle .
The main clinical studies have been carried out on farms in a number of countries in Europe and outside the EU .
the effect of Zactran for the treatment of Germany was investigated compared to another macroliid -@ antibiotic ( tulathromycin ) on cattle already approved in the EU .
the effect of Zactran for the prevention of Germany was investigated compared to a placebo ( sham drug ) on cattle present on the same farm with

What benefit has Zactran shown in these studies ?
it has been shown that Zactran was effective in the treatment and prevention of Germany caused by Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni .
Zactran has proven to be as effective as tulathromycin .
What is the risk associated with Zactran ?
after the injection of zactran , up to 45 % of the animals experience swelling at the injection site in up to 45 % of the animals .
The animals may also show signs of mild pain for a day .
Swelling generally recresses within 3 to 14 days , but can persist in some animals up to 35 days after treatment .
What precautions must be taken by people who administer the drug or come into contact with the animal ?
People with known hypersensitivity ( allergy ) to similar antibiotics ( from the group of macrolides ) should avoid contact with Zactran .
Zactran can cause irritation of the eyes or skin .
therefore , contact with skin or eyes should be avoided .
Zactran comes into direct contact with the eyes , they are immediately rinsed out with clear water .
in case of direct skin contact , the affected area should also be washed off immediately with clear water .
in case of accidental self-injection , a doctor should be consulted immediately and shown the package leaflet or label .
how long must be waited until the slaughter of the beast and for the consumption of the flesh by man ( waiting time ) ?
the animals may only be slaughtered 64 days after the last administration of Zactran .
how long does it have to wait until the animal &apos;s milk can be used for human consumption ?
since the safety of Zactran has not been investigated in breeding animals , the drug must not be used for lactating cows or heifers whose milk is intended for human consumption .
it must also not be used for pregnant cows or heifers whose milk is intended for human consumption in the last two months prior to the date of birth .
Why was Zactran approved ?
the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Zactran in the therapeutic and preventive treatment of respiratory diseases in beef ( Germany ) caused by Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni ( if the occurrence of the disease has been detected in the herd ) outweigh the risks , and recommended that the authorisation for the placing on the market of Zactran .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Macrolide antibiotics , ATCvet -@ Code :
QJ01FA95
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Gamithromycin is an azalide from the group of semi-ynthetic macrolide antibiotics consisting of a 15 -@ C lactton ring with a characteristic alkylated nitrogen atom at position 7A .
this special chemical structure allows the rapid absorption at physiological pH -@ value and the long duration of action in the target tissue lungs .
Macrolide antibiotics have both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects , as they interrupt bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the ribosomal 50S -@ subunit and thus prevent the prolongation of the peptide chain .
in near -@ vitro -@ data prove that gamithromycin has a bactericidal effect .
these pathogenic germs are most commonly involved in Germany .
the following MHK and MBK -@ data come from representative samples of field disolates within various geographical regions of the EU .

Three mechanisms are blamed for the resistance to macrolide antibiotics , also known as MLSB -@ resistance , as it affects macrolide antibiotics , Lincosamides and streptogramins in the same way .
These include the change in the ribosomal binding site , the use of active efflux mechanisms and the production of inactivating enzymes .
5.2 Information on pharmacokinetics
Gamithromycin a dosage of 6 mg / kg body weight is quickly absorbed into the neck of the cattle after single subcutaneous injection .
maximum plasma concentrations are achieved after 30 to 60 minutes .
the plasma -@ half-life is more than 2 days .
in the lungs , maximum concentrations are achieved after less than 24 hours at a lung -@ Plasma -@ ratio of &gt; 264 .

ZUBRIN
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) assesses the documents submitted in order to make recommendations on the use of the veterinary medicinal product .
this document cannot replace the personal conversation with the veterinarian .
If you need more information about the medical condition or treatment of your pet , please contact your veterinarian .
For more information on the basis of the CVMP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( which is also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Zubrin ?
Zubrin is a lyophilisate for taking , i.e. a kind of tablet that quickly disintegrates after contact with moisture , e.g. when it is placed on the dog &apos;s tongue .
Zubrin contains the effective ingredient tepoxalin .
What is Zubrin used ?
Zubrin is used in dogs against inflammation and to relieve pain in acute and chronic diseases of the musculoskeletal system .
Zubrin is administered to the dog once a day about 1 -@ 2 hours after feeding , until the animal is better again .
However , since side effects may occur , any treatment should be carried out for more than 1-2 weeks under regular veterinary control .
How does Zubrin work ?
Zubrin contains tepoxaline , which belongs to the drug class of so-called non-steroidal antiphlogisdrugs ( NSAID ) .
Zubrin works by blocking the enzymes cyclooxygenase -@ 1 and cyclooxygenase -@ 2 .
if these enzymes are blocked , less prostaglandin is formed .
since the prostaglandins are substances that cause inflammation , tepoxalin reduces inflammation and swelling of muscles or joints and the associated pain .

Zubrin has been studied in laboratory animals and sick dogs in various veterinary practices / clinics in the USA and a number of countries in Europe ( &quot; clinical trials &quot; ) .
In these clinical studies , the pet owners administered Zubrin to their dogs once a day at a dose of 10 mg per kg of body weight of the dog with or without food .
the best results were achieved when Zubrin was administered 1 - 2 hours after feeding .
However , since side effects may occur , any treatment should be carried out for more than 1-2 weeks under regular veterinary control .
Zubrin was as effective as other drugs of the same class and led to a significant improvement in dogs with muscle or joint problems .
What are the side effects of Zubrin ?
the side effects of Zubrin are those that can also be observed in other NSAIDs , such as
Vomiting , soft feces or diarrhea , blood in the feces , reduced appetite and weariness .
Vomiting or diarrhea was observed in one in ten dogs .
Occasionally , hair loss or redness of the skin .
if such adverse effects can be observed in your dog , you should not administer Zubrin .
In addition , if your dog receives further medication , you should inform the veterinarian before starting treatment with Zubrin , as some medications can affect each other in their effectiveness .
What precautions must be taken by people who administer the drug or who come into contact with the animal ?
Zubrin has a special dosage form ( lyophilisate ) , which can quickly dissolves in contact with moisture and can become slippery or sticky when held in the hand .
Therefore , you should make sure that you administer the drug with dry hands .
IF the lyophilisate dissolves prematurely in the hand , wash your hands thoroughly .
Zubrin should be put directly in the mouth of the dog , and you should try to keep the dog &apos;s catch closed for a moment .
Zubrin must not be used in humans .
IF someone accidentally takes some tablets , a doctor should be consulted immediately .
Why was Zubrin admitted ?
the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Zubrin in the treatment of inflammation or pain in muscles or joints in dogs outweigh the risks and recommended that authorisation for the placing on the market of Zubrin .
the benefit -@ Risiko -@ ratio can be found in Module 6 of this EPAR .

In March 2001 , the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation to S -@ P Veterinary a marketing authorisation for Zubrin throughout the European Union .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
not include -@ steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ATCvet -@ Code :
QM01AE92
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
tepoxalin is a double cyclooxygenase and 5 -@ lipoxygenase -@ inhibitor with anti-inflammatory effect .
the oral administration of 10 mg tepoxalin / kg body weight leads to an inhibition of prostaglandin and leukotriene -@ synthesis .
5.2 Information on pharmacokinetics
2 hours ) .
After administering a therapeutic dose of 10 mg / kg , the Cmax of tepoxalin fed dogs was 1.08 ± 0.37 µg / ml ( low-fat food ) and 1.19 ± 0.29 µg / ml ( high-fat feed ) .
the absorption of tepoxalin is favoured by administration to fed dogs .
tepoxalin is significantly converted into its acid metabolites .
the acid metabolite is a highly effective cyclooxygenase -@ inhibitor and prolongs the effectiveness of the parent substance .
in the dog , the plasma concentrations of the acid metabolite are higher than those of the parent substance .
after multiple administration over a wide dose range , no accumulation of tepoxalin or its acid metabolites was detected .
tepoxalin and its metabolites are highly bound to proteins , i.e. over 98 % bound to proteins .
tepoxalin and its metabolites are excreted via the ets ( 99 % ) .
