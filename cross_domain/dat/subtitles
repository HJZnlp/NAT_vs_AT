Pidge is right .
I &apos;m just a spout victim .
I am not the leader .
now I am not even worthy to be a paladin .
what was it ?
this is the red lion .
you have to go to him .
never , Keith set him down to tear off my head .
does he calling you ?
I would prefer anything , but the red is not destined for me .
-he chooses you .
-I don &apos;t understand that .
my father created Voltron , but Zarkon is a better leader in the battle , so he became Voltron &apos;s right hand .
Lance , when you accepted Keith as Voltron &apos;s new leader , this showed that a strong team is more important to you than your urge for fame .
like my father .
I do not disappoint him .
Go .
there are still only three .
Where is the rest of the gang ?
we increase the pressure . Let &apos;s see who hurushes to help .
Zethrid , shoot at the black lion with the ion gun .
why on that ?
on this lion is a little different .
his pilot does not have full control .
and Zethrid ? just a grape shot .
we do not want any lasting damage .
Fine .
-Keith , what should we do ?
-we attack .
can you be more precise ?
we need a plan !
Keith !
I &apos;m fine .
but we can &apos;t do it on our own .
not necessary .
now it is slowly getting exciting .
-What was it ?
-The ancient spaceship .
does anyone need help ?
Thank you , Coran .
Zethrid . You were waiting for that .
fire the alttean ship with everything .
Yes , sir !
if anyone else is still there , he will surely come out .
ok . We draw attention to the ship .
Mann .
the lion has it full on it !
be careful with him .
fly your own lion , Keith .
-That was intention !
-That runs far too chaotically .
we organize ourselves .
Keith , what should we do ?
we have to form Voltron , but we lack a lion .
no more .
-Allura ? -Yes !
awesome !
Just look , there are now five kittens .
your orders , sir ?
are we taking ?
No , we have seen enough .
Retreat .
done !
it was on the verge , but yes , we made it .
Allura , you and the blue lion ?
how cool !
Yes , that was a surprise , but a joyful one .
we now know that Zarkon has a son .
- This is deeply disturbing .
-we have to find out more .
bluer , we had some nice adventures .
I wanted to stay with you , but wishes are not always fulfilled .
I will miss you , buddy .
pink ? not what I expected .
but I like it .
yes , on Altea we wear this color in honor of our fallen warriors .
I wear them in honor of the old paladins .
and Shiro .
that is yours now .
I unfortunately had to lose the blue . at least to you .
- Princess !
the black lion flies away !
-Keith , where do you want to go ?
to Lotor &apos;s ship is a tracking transmitter .
get all your lions .
we persecute them .
you wanted me to lead Voltron .
Lotor is on the other side .
in an hour we are close to the attack .
good .
Keep Formation .
I &apos;m sorry .
is an attack now a good idea ?
not everyone comes along with his lion .
-Do you mean me ? -you ?
No !
No , certainly not .
but half of the team sits in new lions .
perhaps we should not take care .
Tell our hot-headed leader .
you wanted me as a leader , now you complain .
Lotor is the heir of the Galra -@ Throns .
we end his rule .
Allura , everything ok in the blue ?
Yes , I flew half my life the castle -@ ship .
I just have to get used to the lion .
well . then we start the attack .
in a Varga the lions arrive .
your commands ?
we should turn and shoot .
we heard all five lions are ready for action .
but otherwise we know little .
keep the ship on track until my return .
makes my hunter ready to go .
I attack the lions themselves .
You cannot defeat them alone .
I don &apos;t intend that at all .
-There is a movement .
-so much on the subject of surprise .
this is just a hunter .
where are the others ?
They are hiding .
we turn it off .
-Lance , what is that ?
-Excry me !
the red is unusually fast for me .
where is the hunter gone ?
Come , move !
I can &apos;t shake him off .
drives it away .
I come .
-Allura !
- Sorry me , Keith .
Seriously , does the thing have braking ?
Allura !
Allura !
what ?
he plays us out against each other .
- This must be Lotor . -Au !
Allura , everything ok with you ?
yes , but the control does not go like with the lock -@ ship .
what &apos;s going on , lion ? do what I command you .
move away !
we should tell Allura that the lions work differently .
I told her not to yell at him .
there she yelled at me .
yes , forget it .
She scares me .
I can hear you !
-Keith , what should we do ?
-does not get in my way if possible !
great leader .
that does not work .
we have to form Voltron .
People , in formation flight .
Guys ?
the Voltron like -@ Feeling does not arise .
goes on !
it does not work !
-What &apos;s going on ?
- Guys !
the hunter !
how disappointing .
Apparently , the reality of Voltron does not do justice to the legend .
that was embarrassing .
and , do we leave it at that , fly back , reforming ourselves , eat something ?
No !
I know we have difficulties , but Lotor must not escape .
Acxa . Set course on the coordinates .
I will lure the lions there .
to the Thayserix ?
why ?
these are not the paladins who defeated father .
what ?
How do you know ?
They do not fight as a unit and cannot form Voltron .
my father did as much damage to the team as they did .
Anyway , they are vulnerable , and we must take advantage of that .
we recalibrate your hunter for the atmosphere on Thayserix .
what ?
what happens on Thayserix ?
the planet consists of dense gases and has magnetic poles that affect normal sensors .
when the lions are there , they are blind .
nothing for wrong , Narti .
hold the cruiser in orbit around Thayserix .
I scare away of the lions , and you grab them .
he hides .
we better not follow him , because what awaits us ?
Guys , we have a problem !
my sensors play crazy .
probably because of the atmosphere and the magnet -@ Poland of the planet .
we have no time for that .
he must not escape .
without the sensors and the equipment , we do not see where it is up and down or how we get out .
-we should go back . -No !
fly on !
what ? I just heard &quot; flying . &quot;
have we fly back ?
do you also hear a noise ?
I no longer see you .
-Macht slower !
-we have to stay tuned .
- He escapes .
-the gases make radio contact more difficult .
we have to stay together to communicate .
we have probably survived the worst .
No ! No !
Allura was hit !
I fly after her .
Hunk !
you others stay with me !
Keith , we should take care of Allura .
Keith , you separate the team !
Keith , don &apos;t do that !
stop playing with them !
get it ready !
-is it all doing well ?
I &apos;m sorry I was braking . -the blue does not listen to me .
-Already ok .
our team holds together .
-or , Keith ?
-it &apos;s not just about the team .
the mission is more important than any individual .
we have to find Lotor and stop him , and that &apos;s exactly what I intend to do .
comes , people , we should stay together .
Prince Lotor needs your support on Thayserix .
we are waiting for you here immediately .
Lotor is directly above the lion .
and they have no idea .
Then why doesn &apos;t he shoot ?
he could tear them in shreds .
-Blows them into the air !
-That is not possible .
The area is full of red Syntian -@ nitrate . A highly explosive gas that responds to increased light -@ emissions .
that will be good .
that is mistzy here .
we see practically nothing .
stays together .
he must be somewhere here .
I know .
there !
-Where is he ? -Who knows ?
the radars do not work .
Guys . Do you feel he is playing with us ?
I see it the same way , great one .
the guy scares me .
-he deliberately lured us here .
-Up there !
we have to leave !
this is a trap !
the tide has turned .
the hunters become the hunted !
Hunk to knock sayings does not take us any further !
Lance is right .
stay calm , get ready .
he attacks .
forms a circle .
we have to be prepared for everything .
as soon as you see it , you fire with everything you have .
now !
Fire !
Hello everyone ?
Paladins ? Help !
Wow , you can hide , but I will find you .
what happened ?
Where is the rest of the team ?
that is my guilt .
I was fully tapped into his trap .
everyone warned me , but I didn &apos;t want to hear .
I put the whole team in danger .
yes , somehow .
but now we have to do that .
you are right .
we retitreat .
Hello everyone ?
does anyone hear me ?
is there anyone ?
Pidge !
Hunk !
Oh my God .
I &apos;m glad I found you .
do you repair the radar , find the rest and get us out of here ?
without data constant I can not calibrate , that would have gone before we flew into this gas -@ planet .
and what does that mean ?
-That is , we sit in a clamp .
Hello everyone ?
can anyone hear me ?
ok , stay calm , Allura .
think .
what would Lance do ?
Hallihello , blue lion .
you know ... you are now really activating my particle lock now .
nothing works .
I tried with friendly requests and orders .
what do you ask of me ?
I can &apos;t .
everyone relies on me .
the whole universe . but I can &apos;t control everything .
I ... I need your help .
I hear you .
Help me .
Lead me .
I can &apos;t do it alone .
a sonar card .
do you also think what I think , Blue ?
someone has learned something .
come on .
almost .
Nitrate gas !
Do the freezing beams work ?
I have no control over the left wing .
Good , Paladin .
we made it , Blue .
now we have to find the others .
Hey , Pidge .
would you be stranded on a planet and could still eat something else ...
what would that be ?
a burrito ?
you like Burritos .
I would take a burrito .
Hey , I call Pidge and Hunk .
- Are you paladins looking for a way out ?
-Madness !
you have found us !
Allura has found you .
She found us all .
-She connected with the lion .
-how did you do that ?
I behaved like Lance and stopped thinking .
yes , think like Lance .
-oment , do you call me stupid ?
-No , you are a natural talent .
-Yes , of course stupid .
-from birth .
it &apos;s nice to raise Lance . - but we have to find out here .
- Follow me .
I know the way . Waits a tick .
we have company .
-Lotor has probably called reinforcement .
- Oh man , something is always .
we have to form Voltron .
but last time we could not form Voltron .
we have to try .
maybe we were too divided and disorganized , we only get out of here if we work together .
we are a team .
Shiro believed in us .
we must believe in ourselves .
do you think so too ?
-Yes ! -so then ...
makes Voltron !
I recognize an unknown energy -@ signature .
-Hunk , I &apos;m a leg .
-Pretty cool , isn &apos;t it ?
Lotor escapes .
are we flying after ?
No .
we put ourselves in this situation through false ambition .
we must be ready for him .
understood team leader .
where have we fly in ?
Voltron is there at the back .
we have to fight now !
a leader knows when to leave the battlefield .
we determine when we face them .
You can form Voltron again .
is that a problem ?
No .
an opportunity .
-What is it ?
-Yes , we do not know this alarm .
Allura , what is ?
were you seeing a ghost ?
we have .
this is an ancient emergency call .
of King Alfors ships .
-are we not the last Alteans ?
-Moment .
what if this is a trap ?
this is an ancient ship , and we fly there .
this is a Tel -@ Galax -@ exploration ship .
it explores the depths of the universe .
according to the identification code , the traling is a fleet cruiser .
but here there is nothing about the goal or mission .
-What &apos;s wrong with him ?
-is this a wormhole ?
this is not a normal wormhole .
it generates huge amounts of energy where the ship is stuck .
we see if someone is on board .
You need help .
we could send a drone to take a closer look at it .
good .
the energy is neither radioactive nor thermal .
It also does not produce gravity , and the light shines out , unlike black holes .
-but where does the light come from ?
-I know this energy -@ signature .
that is quintessence !
not good .
ok , do we stay away from the thing , yes ?
does not work .
have you not just seen that ?
Voltron is much more stable than anything else in the universe .
we received an ancient emergency signal , so there is someone on the ship .
as paladins of Voltron we must help .
but I still believe this could be a trap .
and it &apos;s too dangerous anyway to fly in anyway .
I fly alone when I have to .
ok , very slowly .
Pidge , can you explain this to me in front of us ?
the Euclidean space around the ship is an anomaly .
but the energy does not come from a source that fits into our reality .
that was probably a no .
I scan for biorhythms .
Strangely , I don &apos;t receive any signs of life .
maybe not here , but the ship is bigger .
-we have to go through .
-through the glowing inferno ?
Pidge , keep an eye on Voltron &apos;s functions in mind .
we break off immediately when it becomes precarious .
understood , then we break off immediately .
Guys , my sensors play crazy .
we should explode just like the drone .
but somehow does not affect the space curvature Voltron .
Hello everyone ?
what can you see ?
the connection breaks off .
Hello everyone ?
No !
we have to be through . That is the nose of the ship .
Moment .
the rear part of the ship is gone .
Coran ! Coran !
we can no longer see the castle .
-Coran , do you hear me ?
and where does the planet come from ?
according to the sensors , we are exactly where we were .
Guys , that sounds strange now , but now I receive several biorhythms .
Alteaner .
it seems as if there is only one way to find out what &apos;s going on .
Hello everyone ?
is anyone here ?
here it is totally scary .
does anyone still think this is a ghost ship ?
or just me ?
has the crew given up the ship ?
unclear . but without the spacesuits they did not come ...
there is someone in it !
Thanks to King Alfor we found the second meteorite .
we have rescued him , but it causes severe disturbances .
we fly to Altea , but it is unclear whether we can do it .
at the moment ...
What happened here ?
something deadly .
that still does not explain the biorhythms .
Be careful !
-Not to be graspable .
Shiro ?
-how to ...
back !
you never get the meteorite .
I die rather than leaving it to old teans .
Shiro , please .
My name is Shiro .
What &apos;s going on here ?
why does he suddenly speak so strangely ?
-You know us ?
-Of course !
you are our leader and a paladin .
and you are Slav .
I have freed you .
and you &apos;re mistaken .
-That may be true , but you have never freed me from anything .
or ...
this is a parallel universe .
what please ?
when we flew through the energy field , we landed in a parallel universe .
something like what Slav is always talking about ?
not you .
but another .
-he is constantly talking about other realities .
-seems familiar to me .
were you attacked the crew ?
-Back , Alteanerin .
-we do not .
but it is good that they are dead .
-Oh no , even more Alteans !
-What ?
even more Alteans ?
You have noticed your arrival .
Sven , away here !
prefers to disappear .
What &apos;s going on here ?
does that mean a bunch of Alteans boarded the ship ?
Weapons gone !
Alteaner .
impossible .
Empress .
I am confused .
how was that ?
are you Empress Allura ?
I am Princess Allura .
please rise .
I am Commander Hira , Empress .
how can that be ?
you put down the Galra -@ uprising . You founded our empire . 10,000 years ago .
where we come from , Zarkon destroyed your planet and wiped out the Alteans .
where do you come from ?
fascinating .
your theory about Voltron has been confirmed .
I had hoped to experience a bigger fireworks .
all previous recovery -@ attempts were more entertaining .
Well , not for your pilots .
Voltron got through because he is made of the same material as the meteorite that King Alfor wanted to hide from his father .
let &apos;s see if the new paladins bring him to us .
and when Voltron is trapped in the other dimension ?
in the other reality , Ezor .
and when Voltron is trapped in the other reality ?
Voltron is stuck there , we are rid of him .
if he comes back with the meteorite , we will get it up .
for us , both are a victory .
this is the meteorite Trayling spoke of .
he is stuck between the realities , like the ship .
can you take a sample ?
I &apos;m trying .
incredible .
this is Voltron .
what ?
it is of course not really Voltron , but the energy waves are the ones Zarkon was looking for .
and those who led us to the blue lion .
so you could get into this reality .
Your vehicle is made of the same transreal material .
therefore Voltron is so powerful .
with this material , Altea can build its own transreal ships .
we can extend our peace to all realities .
General Hira , I have discovered something on the ship that secures Altea &apos;s rule over millennia .
the Alteans of this reality have defeated the Galra ?
under your leadership , Empress .
If you had not fought and avenged your father , Altea could never have provided peace throughout the universe .
that is the last one .
Do you think the plan works ?
do not worry .
I am 60 % sure this is one of the 0.15 % realities in which this plan works 100 % .
whether people from the other reality help the Alteans ?
if they are really my friends , it is 72 % likely that they will decide correctly .
first we had to beat Zarkon , and since then we bring the true peace of Altea .
that is wonderful .
no stress , no wars .
-That is unimaginable . -really ?
take Moxilous .
For centuries , his people waged war against his neighboring planets .
what a barbaric life .
but look at him now .
what is different ?
the Hoktril .
the greatest technical achievement of our civilization .
what does he do ?
he deprives our enemies of their fighting power .
their will , one could say .
we are further .
who was still lost in Empress Allura &apos;s time will be rehabilitated .
Peoples who have waged war for millennia can now live in peace and support our new order .
as part of the ancient peace movement ?
are we talking about slavery here ?
No .
without will they are not slaves .
Slaves constantly flee or revolbel .
the controlled ones like to do what they are told .
the protection of life is a top priority in our empire .
and with this we achieve more than we have ever dreamed of .
but you take their free will from them .
the will that would kill you without hesitation .
Thanks to us , no innocent person must die through the free will of an evil being .
Empress Allura , I &apos;ll show you something .
this is our Altea .
comes with us .
Let me show you all its splendor .
does anyone else find these guys oblique ?
Something is wrong with these Alteans .
they have quasi smashed the brain of the big guy .
Huhu , up here .
how did you find us ?
-the probability was great ...
-Well , forget it .
we have to get away to Keith and Allura and the meteorites .
we are on it .
but you have to help us with one thing .
perfect .
I suspected that forces of the Gamara were on board .
but not that Empress Allura &apos;s friends help them .
See Altea again .
it seemed an unrealizable dream that I never dared to dream of .
Allura , that &apos;s not the Altea you knew .
that is true .
this Altea has prevented the Galra from spreading throughout the universe , as with you .
Empress , we will do everything to help you .
the meteorite on this ship can travel between the realities .
If you activate this ship , we can free the ship and the meteorite from the crack .
then we fly into your universe and bring you peace . even the Galra .
thinks carefully about it , Allura .
even recently we thought all Galra were evil .
maybe it is not as easy as she does .
Keith , that is my people , which would be the strongest alliance we have .
I have tried everything .
I can &apos;t find Voltron .
how should I stop them ?
you know them .
I don &apos;t understand a word , but I suppose it was an insult .
not good .
managed , Allura .
soon we will carry our peace into every reality .
What is that all about ?
Empress , the forces of the Gamara are on board .
They helped them .
let our friends free .
Hira , you and all of Altea have transformed the universe into a slave kingdom .
no one is free .
Slaves ?
is that true ?
the controlled are not slaves .
and you are spreading chaos and destruction !
we will scan your brain and find out where the rebels are .
finally the war can end .
-Allura , we must not allow that .
-Hira , please .
we both want the same .
Peace .
Oh yes ?
through your weakness your people suffer from the Galra .
but we gave our peace .
and now we bring peace to every reality .
you are not my empress .
and you are not an alttean woman .
what &apos;s there to laugh about ?
we are in reality where everything goes out well .
perfect timing .
on him !
go .
-Pidge , where are the lions ?
-left down !
Sven , everything ok ?
You saved me .
that will be again .
just takes me to the hospital .
we are stuck to everyone :
to hold on !
does he do that in every reality ?
I take care of Sven .
get your lions !
I am to blame .
I activated the spaceship .
They get the meteorite and terrorize every reality .
No , you can recapture the meteorite !
-Pidge , look for the meteorite .
-I have already located his signature .
we fly in and get him up .
makes Voltron !
ok , and what now ?
we can only return at the point of our arrival .
shoot down !
-Activate drive .
-Drive ready .
what &apos;s going on ?
Drive failed .
Persecution impossible .
I love this reality !
destroys them !
I have it !
No !
you are back !
Thanks to the ancestors !
Paladine , do you hear me ?
everything ok ?
nice that my emergency signal attracted you , Voltron .
do you hear me ? everything ok ?
Coran , we are still alive .
Allura , you have done the right thing .
Hira was not allowed to have the meteorite .
-but now Lotor has him .
-You could not guess that .
that is the problem .
we are always unaware .
therefore my father sent the lions away .
to protect them from this reality .
-Finally I understand it .
-we bring him back .
and if not ?
Lotor is always one step ahead of us .
he has something in mind with the meteorite , and if he succeeds , the Galra have a weapon as deadly as Voltron .
ok , folks , destination .
I give you cover ... Hey , Keith , I would have caught him !
there are still some !
that was awesome !
Pidge , could you accelerate something ?
almost ...
done !
super , Pidge .
-This is the last outpost here .
-Contacts the blade of Marmora .
tells them the base is liberated .
Well , I only remember how Zarkon wanted to steal the lion and I should use the Bayard .
after that I know nothing anymore .
I just woke up on the Galra -@ ship .
you have activated the teleport mode of the black lion .
did he teleport you ?
maybe he wanted to help you .
by delivering me over to the Galra ?
maybe Zarkon has manipulated him .
he tried to control the lion until the end , right ?
yes , maybe .
So as soon as you feel up to it , the others are certainly happy to see you .
They need you .
yes , I &apos;m trying .
ok , we are on the bridge .
-Hey , Keith ?
-Yes ?
how many times will you save me before all this is over ?
as often as I have .
good work , people .
you have brought the decisive turn .
good that you have remained faithful to the mission .
you look good .
How are you ?
good , except for the strange headaches .
Guys , I have something .
I downloaded data from the fallen Galra -@ base .
I deciphered them and found something about Lotor .
-Do you know where he is ?
-No . but his command ship was sighted in the Va &apos;Kar -@ quadrant .
well done , Pidge .
but these quadrants are huge .
how can we find him ?
the comet is made of the same material as Voltron .
I scan for Fraunhofer -@ lines , just like the blue lion .
which are subject to free induction decay .
which is exponential .
but if we amplify the sensors ...
No , too many interferences .
-Let &apos;s increase the radiation intensity .
-the tops of the lock !
awesome !
I only understood train station .
we are now heading for the Va &apos;Kar -@ quadrant .
it hurries .
who knows what Lotor intends to do with the comet ?
yes ?
Hey , man , I wanted to talk to you briefly because ...
because I &apos;m worried .
definitely when you come to me with it .
-you are the leader now .
treasures .
I expected .
we are now six paladins , but we have only five lions , that is , we are a paladin too much .
you are right .
Shiro takes over the black , you want your red .
and I would have to take Allura away the blue .
but she learns faster than all of us .
It could achieve unimagined things .
that is true .
so I would do the team a favor if I leave .
What are you talking about ?
this is not about ego .
we have war .
it is necessary to choose the best .
Do not break your head , and think of the mission .
that will be .
ok , thank you .
And , Lance leaves the arithmetic Pidge .
Thank you for joining this .
I would never have come .
I know you are dirty .
I owe you a shower .
but first we are looking for Lotor , right ?
let &apos;s throw on the thing and see if it works .
perhaps the polarity is not true .
People .
I have the comet , but he moves .
Coran ?
Allura ?
can an Altean push the castle ?
we are on it .
we catch up .
keep your distance so that we are not noticed .
the signal came to stop in the Ulippa -@ system .
activate scanners .
this is not Lotor .
but the comet is in it .
-Ok , people ...
-we do the following ...
Oh , I &apos;m sorry .
Let go , Shiro .
we need the comet .
he should be safely into the base .
it is vulnerable during transport .
there we strike .
who , to the vulture , are these types ?
a transport is probably not the plan .
-we need more detailed information .
-take the black lion .
I support you with Coran .
Keith , are you sure ?
yes .
-What &apos;s going on ?
-Shiro , where do you stay ?
we need you !
-eith , you have to lead the mission .
-What ?
Why ?
the black lion does not react .
you are his paladin now .
I come .
this is the worst base in the empire .
but it is my base !
Victory or death !
we have to find the comet .
then we find out who the guys are .
have you gone it ?
Lotor sends you to finish what he started ?
we are on board .
no trace of the crew .
we are looking further .
here long .
I kill him !
-No , you know the plan !
My life is unimportant .
only the empire counts !
switch off systems .
sounds as if the battle is over .
fast on .
I open the roof .
Coran , enlarge the picture .
is the ...
the Teludav !
what in the name of King Groggerys the frail , is this ?
he must be here .
right in front of us .
where is the comet ?
in the ship ?
I think the ship is the comet .
he built a ship from the ore of the comet ?
-That is evil .
-Terrible even .
People ...
in the Galra and -@ base is a part of the Teludav .
the who worm Zarkon &apos;s ship ?
but they can &apos;t serve it without ancient ...
Zarkon &apos;s witch !
She had ancient times .
-Is anyone else freaking out here ?
-Yes , I sign up for freaking out .
Lotor must be here .
we have to turn it off .
Lotor may not have the ship .
back to the lions , and form Voltron !
why destroy the ship if we can turn off Lotor ?
he constantly outwits us all the time .
That is why Lotor is not allowed to get this ship .
too dangerous .
Keith , I want to stop Lotor , but Shiro is right .
ok , go to the lions .
I &apos;m looking for Lotor .
Keith , you have to stay together .
-I agree with Shiro . -I too .
-me too .
-Yes .
Well , then go .
I &apos;ll help you !
Pidge , help me !
I rarely fight against worthy opponents .
Destroying you will give me joy .
we have no time for it .
to the lions !
good idea .
Zethrid , stop !
Come on !
we can finally destroy them .
we have what we wanted .
stick to the plan .
Seriously . What &apos;s going on here ?
who are they ?
I saw one of them in the Weblum .
She stole Scaultrit .
and they have an alttean woman ?
You want to open worm holes with the Teludav .
was the ship out of the comet , we have quite different worries .
I thought Lotor took over for Zarkon .
why does he attack a base ?
no idea , so we must finally stop him .
-we have to stop the transport ship .
-Is made .
-This must be the ship from the comet .
-Be careful .
Particle barrier and defense systems .
-a fast , small bastard .
and a damn more manoeuvrable .
-the particle barrier is damaged .
-People , where are you ?
another hit , and it &apos;s over !
forms the sword !
busy Voltron until the ship is out of reach .
Do not be provoked .
the sword is deadly .
it &apos;s too fast !
People the cargo ship escapes with the Teludav .
I thought we should destroy the comet -@ ship .
but Lotor must not have the Teludav .
Shiro is right .
we destroy him .
but the comet -@ ship is in front of our nose !
Keith , the cargo ship escapes !
a good thing .
They must defend themselves or pursue the Teludav unprotected .
-the Teludav escapes !
-Keith , what now ?
lowers the shield and shoots at the cargo ship . Risks it .
or we hit this and then the cargo ship .
no time !
You have to decide !
Hunk , your Bayard .
we lower the shield and shoot at the cargo ship .
-ready ?
-ready !
They attack the cargo ship .
ikea kallax hax .
Let &apos;s go !
Fire !
again !
Your failure is extremely disappointing .
comes back before more Galra -@ ships appear .
so Lotor attack the Galra -@ base to steal the Teludav ?
how confusing .
no matter , they escape !
-Afterwards . -No .
comes back to the castle .
we have to get out what is going on here .
I &apos;m sorry I interfered .
-I thought I had it under control .
you have to learn to set priorities .
sometimes that hurts .
-I am not suitable for the leader .
-Yes , you do .
Thanks to your quick response , Lotor did not escape with the Teludav .
You pack that .
the black lion has chosen you .
I am proud of you .
I just know these people had the right access codes .
you have to believe me !
I do that . Nevertheless , you have to pay for your failure .
Ulaz ?
Operation Kuron , phase one successful .
Start phase two .
Come on !
Come on !
Message to the command center .
Operation Kuron , Phase three has started .
General Rath ...
-I have an order for you .
-I am in the service of Galra .
Lotor &apos;s perception is no longer so clear since he returned .
it was risky to bring him back after his absence .
I am worried about the path he has been leading us since then .
you have to keep an eye on him .
Follow his battlecruiser and report me any suspicious behavior .
Vrepit sa .
what killed you ?
Help .
that must be the one who crashed with his pod .
Experimental Y0XT39 reacts normally to optical stimuli .
approved for Operation Curon .
-What does he say ?
-hard to say , but he comes out .
-What is this noise ?
-I look after .
he wakes up .
-Did you force him ?
-Which ones ?
otherwise his arm turns into a weapon .
-the red one ?
-we have only one clrule !
Where am I ?
why am I connected ?
-do we eat it ?
-he doesn &apos;t look like a Galra .
-Then we do not eat it ?
-No .
-I &apos;m not a Galra .
-All the worse .

we did not allially with them !
I am not working for them .
I am on your side .
I am Shiro , a paladin of Voltron .
but I was taken prisoner .
I suppose .
-I fought against Zarkon .
-Against Zarkon ?
Of course , and I am the Phloban of Gargalax .
please , have you never heard of Voltron ?
the lion .
what happened to them ?
how much time has passed ?
the Galra has been sending spies to us for years .
and now they have sent you to listen to us ?
a joke .
No , I fled .
you fled from a Galra -@ battleship ?
-I don &apos;t buy it from you !
-it is true .
I took a pod .
They bombarded me and hit my pod .
they do not do that with allies .
please . check my identity with the blade of Marmora or Voltron .
-with a traceable signal ? No .
-Look around .
our supplies here are limited .
we like to watch you starving until you finally tell the truth .
Prince Lotor , the scanners recognize an anomaly again .
exact coordinates .
I want to see them .
nothing .
what do you expect ?
three such appearances in one day cannot be a coincidence .
Persecutors ? -We know .
-unless they have the scanners -@ logs .
-Then they distort the measurements .
-Only the Galra can access them .
activates the heat -@ sensors and fires around the anomaly .
Why ?
we shoot them down !
I want to know who that is .
it is a Galra -@ battleship .
we bring our guest on board .
No !
Lotor requires support on Thayserix .
we are waiting for you here immediately .
-Thayserix ?
where is that ?
-Not far from here .
They cross the quadrant .
Take this with the Klygarg .
I hate the Klygarg .
how does it work again ?
enter your password . -Sure .
What is my password ?
-do not know , it &apos;s yours !
I catch another message .
-Also draw them .
-I didn &apos;t even record the first .
Prince Lotor gave us an order .
we should intercept Voltron .
Voltron ?
See if he is ready to talk .
Vakala !
come here !
we should have eaten it .
he is injured .
he can &apos;t be far away .
I &apos;m looking outside , you in the tunnels .
I don &apos;t want to hurt you !
please do not shoot !
you never meet !
Let me ! -here with it !
-No , it belongs to me !
stop immediately , otherwise I will shoot !
you are on the wrong side of the war .
No , that is not true .
I am on your side .
my name is Shiro , and as I said , I am a paladin of Voltron .
it doesn &apos;t matter what I say . You don &apos;t believe me , so ...
I have to go back to my team and I need your help .
Thayserix .
a gigantic gas planet .
according to the news we intercepted , Voltron is there ... or he was there .
-I have to go there .
were you taking a ship ?
-Only a shuttle to dock on ships in orbit , not to cross space .
here , excuse me for hanging you on my wrist .
Thank you .
I &apos;m sorry the gun hit your face .
Oh , that was neither the first nor the last time .
Shiro , I don &apos;t see a way for you to Thayserix .
-What about the Galra -@ Kreuzer ?
-What about him ?
if he flies close by , I smuggle myself on board .
on board a Galra -@ cruiser ?
you got ed from a Galra -@ ship . and now you want to break into one ?
You &apos;re crazier than me .
and I live voluntarily on an ice planet .
is it possible or not ?
the cruiser is within reach , but it jumps right into the Hyper -@ Drive .
I hurry .
Thank you for your help .
whether he makes it onto the battleship and then to Voltron ?
is the one he pretends to be , he has a chance .
you know this was our only ship ?
the cruiser identifies the shuttle as soon as it is within reach .
because the shuttle is so small , the bridge is not informed .
the defense system destroys everything in visual contact .
the sensors identify you as a space debris .
you have to be fast .
go to the blasters .
there you come on board .

but I am not my father .

I have lost visual and radar contact with Voltron .
I keep my course .
I am four days away from Thayserix .
no food or water .
SOS file -@ Signal is enabled .
no signs from anyone .
I am on the road for seven days .
the oxygen runs out , the fuel is consumed .
that will be my last entry .
what &apos;s going on ?
we have found it .
Master , I ask for forgiveness , but I know no other way .
Your empire needs you .
there we fought , there were his generals , and he stole the meteorite .
Lotor could be anywhere .
without knowing what he is up to do , we never find him .
What are the connections ?
why is Voltron made of the same material as the meteorite ?
what is so special about it ?
Father discovered a meteorite before my birth .
Your father . and Zarkon .
when Zarkon was Paladin of the black lion ?
even before .
before Alfor built the lions .
it hurts to talk about it , but since we want to stop Lotor , we have to hear the rest .
In the beginning , the Paladins were five great leaders , and although they came from cultures that were very different and had been waging war for generations , they settled their differences to protect their common interests .
which in the beginning was rather a purpose alliance at the beginning , developed into a friendship .
a warrior league had arisen , and they kept away those who would harm them .
Oje .
I warn you again and again of going alone , Alfor .
As an alchemist , you are much wiser than a soldier .
for this I have you , Zarkon .
the original paladins were Zarkon of Daibazaal ,
King Alfor of Altea , Gyrgan of Rygnirath ,
Trigel of the Dalterion -@ belt and Blaytz by Nalquoud .
Sit down , eat and drink !
Fraternization with the servant class is not allowed .
because of the discipline .
a little less discipline would do you good , Zarkon .
I remember when you are surrounded by Lambonit -@ looters surround you .
-I had the gang well under control .
-the gang had you under control .
why do I just get involved with these crooks ?
because we are the only crooks on your side .
on us !
at Rygnirath .
They did not suspect that after that night the universe would be different forever .
we evacuated all Galra -@ residents at the crater .
-What did you find out ?
-I don &apos;t know .
this meteorite is different from the others .
His material changes the realities .
-What do you mean by that ?
Scholars have always had the theory that several realities exist .
whole other universes with stories of which we know nothing about .
but you could never prove it .
so far , because when we moved the meteorite we discovered this here .
that is another reality ?
-What is it ?
-No fear .
this is Kova .
-it comes from our reality .
-Zarkon . this is Honerva .
She is the best alchemist of Altea .
I invited her to Daibazaal . as a research director .
Their expertise is priceless .
Isn &apos;t that exciting ?
it could turn the understanding of the universe upside down .
well , find out everything you can .
I give you every support .
I have to go .
that was short .
King Alfor experimented with the ore on Altea , while Honerva continued to research the abyss on Daibazaal .
but Alfor often came to visit , and the years passed .
Zarkon . This is Princess Allura .
very pleased .
a gift in honor of your birth , princess .
Honerva tamed you .
I never thought that the great warrior would marry Zarkon , plus an alttean alchemist .
Honerva , diligent as always .
Thank you for the gift .
Allura likes it .
-That was just a common gesture .
-Of course .
-What makes the quintessence -@ experiment ?
-it is running .
one year with a drop of quintessence , without loss of revolutions per debut .
there is no comparable energy source .
my ships work according to the same principle . The ore develops almost by itself .
it &apos;s somehow terrifying .
infinitely strong spaceships for the Galra -@ Imperium .
and an endless source of clean energy for the universe .
of course .
what is it ?
I sent signals to the neighbor -@ reality . and this creature responded to it .
nothing from our universe survived the passage through the transition .
-but this being came through unscathed .
-What ?
I thought we wanted to be careful .
we don &apos;t know what &apos;s out there .
in the past it was believed that lightning came from the arrows of the gods until others were proved .
in our pursuit of knowledge , we penetrate into dangerous terrain .
Alfor and Honerva built a particle -@ barrier around the crater to stop the creatures .
but she would not last forever .
the barrier becomes weaker .
we have little time for us .
when the creatures come out , my troops are overrun .
my planet , my people .
-Alfors project will save us .
-Let &apos;s hope .
I hope your plan works , Alfor .
at Rygnirath !
incredible .
Alfor , they are fantastic .
how do they work ?
I shaped them from the meteorite -@ ore and quintessence . So they have an endless energy -@ stock .
impressive !
Alloy with a meteorite -@ ore makes them almost indestructible .
what armament do they have ?
now it will be really interesting .
ancient alchemy can create great feats .
but when I tested my spaceship , I suddenly felt some kind of psychic connection .
how can I explain it ? the ship did not just read my thoughts .
it communicated with me .
They are developing .
we do not know their abilities , but we understand it over time .
with time ?
time escapes , and we are standing here .
Creatures of another empire soon slaughter my people .
without these spaceships all hope is lost !
understand .
that will be hard work .
these are not ordinary spaceships .
you do not choose the lion .
the lion chooses you .
be careful at the beginning .
They have greater energy than anything you know .
lead the formation .
you understand the ships best .
I am an alchemist , not a military leader .
-I remain your right hand .
-now good .
on my sign , Paladine !
right Alfor and Blaytz !
left Trigel and Gyrgan !
Paladine , I fly ahead and distract him .
you others attack from all sides !
Fire !
continues to fire !
these stupid things block me !
Blaytz !
-Thank you , Alfor !
-Always like .
Head bick -@ Screw !
-I do not meet !
-Retreat , paladins !
we are reforming .
is waiting !
we form a new formation .
-What ? why ?
-I don &apos;t know , but I feel it .
-Hey , I feel it too !
-me too !
What is going on here ?
Voltron .
-Incredible , we did it !
-how did that come about ?
am I a leg ?
-these forces are just incredible .
-This is Voltron .
a shield !
well done , Trigel !
-it wants to crush us !
-we have to get rid of it !
I know what we &apos;re doing .
we seal the transition .
seal the transition ?
why ? he almost destroyed Daibazaal !
the creatures almost destroyed Daibazaal . but you defeated them .
Zarkon , you agree with me .
it must be sealed .
maybe not .
Just see what we won , Alfor .
your spaceships are the most powerful machines .
what else do we discover if we continue working ?
you risk your planet , the whole solar system ? -What for what ?
for more power ?
-you know it &apos;s about more .
we already have Voltron .
that is enough .
I &apos;m in charge here !
I &apos;m sorry , Alfor .
the work continues .
Honerva continued her experiments at the transition .
Despite their differences , Zarkon , Alfor and the Paladins established a new era of peace and prosperity .
Voltron gained fame as a defender of the universe , and the legend that lives on to this day .
I heard there were three more earthquakes .
Do not worry , I stabilize the planets -@ cohesion .
my scientists scanned Daibazaal .
the planet disintegrated .
the integrity ...
I don &apos;t stop off Honerva &apos;s work now .
She discovers more every day !
her team developed a space cruiser that is five times larger than our ships .
-but that &apos;s not all .
-Hello , Honerva .
it &apos;s Deca Durabolin -@ Phoebs her .
I hope you don &apos;t come to finish my work .
There is more knowledge and power in this gap than you can ever understand .
I &apos;m just worried about the stability ...
is that Kova ?
how old is he now ?
28 Deca Durabolin , -@ Phoebs .
after the creatures attacked , he fell ill .
but then I treated him with quintessence .
No .
he has revealed the truth to us .
Quintessence is so much more than you understand .
-It is life itself .
-you have gone too far .
you coward .
Honerva , you ...
you want to prevent enlightenment .
we should increase the passage .
with Voltron we facilitate access to the other reality .
that is madness !
Quintessence poisoned your mind .
that is just the surface .
we can rule the universe ! -we can live forever !
we all !
-I don &apos;t want to be a part of that .
you &apos;re just a part of Voltron , Alfor .
Do not hold us all out of fear .
Alfor , I lead the paladins !
You follow my orders !
Alfor !
Honerva ?
Honerva !
we have to ...
we must have it .
we have to have it . Come back .
-Come back .
-What then , my beloved ?
Quintessenz .
The quintessence is life .
into the transition .
what ?
we have to ... we have to ...
Voltron .
Voltron .
that is the only way .
Alfor tried to warn me , but I didn &apos;t hear .
now my wife has become sick , and my planet is about to disintegrate .
I beseech you , my faithful companions , to accompany me on a dangerous mission .
we have to seal the transition , and Voltron must do that .
we will help you .
I hope it &apos;s not too late to save my planet , and our friendship .
Alford &apos;s compassion for his comrade made him blind to Zarkon &apos;s real plans .
according to Honerva , we can only close the transition with the power of quintessence .
To do this , we must first increase the opening .
-how should that work ?
-with the sword .
Form a sword !
-This is too difficult .
-Concentrate !
Where are we ?
in transition .
No !
Zarkon , what are you planning to do ?
-we have to take them away here !
-Fast .
the creatures have returned !
everywhere !
Fire lasers !
Trigel , grab them !
Gyrgan , Blaytz , control rockets !
away here !
Zarkon &apos;s attempt to save Honerva was in vain .
both succumbed to the radiation overload of the quintessence .
Zarkon had deceived the paladins .
They had increased the transition , which further destabilized Daibazaal .
King Alfor was forced to evacuate the planet .
he made the transition in the only way he knew .
he destroyed the home of the Galra .
King Alfor organized a state funeral for Zarkon and Honerva .
but what happened there , he could never have imagined .
-Where am I ?
-on board your ship , sir .
brings us home .
I can &apos;t , sir .
Daibazaal was destroyed .
my Galra and companions .
King Alfor of Altea has destroyed our planet .
he will pay dearly for his crimes .
Join your Emperor !
revenge will be ours !
Zarkon became an evil par excellence , obsessed with quintessence .
for a new opening between the realities he needed Voltron .
and so the war began .
the Galra immediately followed their leader and attacked .
the planets were not prepared for this .
soon they were all conquered , except for Altea .
In order not to drop Voltron into Zarkon &apos;s hands , the lions were sent to distant corners .
Zarkon raced in anger .
he killed King Alfor . He atoned for the loss of Daibazaal with the destruction of Altea .
So this is Lotor &apos;s plan .
to penetrate other universes . -to get the purest quintessence .
-no matter how . we have to stop him .
my husband , how could I forget that ?
You have brought me back to life .
Now I get you back .
Since I know I would like Julia as a girlfriend , I want to look good whenever I see her .
so what is important to girls . but looking good is hard .

Shit , Casey .
this is a real man !
already fucked , or are you still fumbling ?
yes , of course .
Casey is totally prudish .
She didn &apos;t even kissed a guy .
you didn &apos;t tell anything about a friend .
why don &apos;t you tell me about it ?
he &apos;s not my friend , we just depend out .

is that true ?
- Do you hang out with his penis ?
- No , Sharice .

Do you like movies ?

Snowshoeing was his idea .
I hate the cold .

in any case , it is great that you show interest in others .
That is what we have worked on that .

I should talk to mom .
so it usually works , but Mom is with the group today .
maybe I can help .
I like a girl .

- That is good .
how is it like ?
- She is smart , and she is pretty .
and she has a friend , Miles .
cursed Miles .
Well , that &apos;s crap .
but you know , this is not the end of the world .
Mom had one when I met her .
- In fact ?
- This guy , Gerald Redenbach .
he had a jeep and a golden retriever . He wore a scarf .
She found him so cool .
and you stretched out his mom ?
so in the kind .
how ?
I was always close to her and was sweet and charming .
- It worked ?
- Take the pudding test .
- I don &apos;t like pudding .
- Forget the pudding .
the point is , you &apos;re young , Sam .
Relationships come and go .
She may have her friend this week and next week , who knows ?
do you understand ?
yes .
I consider myself available in case Miles leaves or dies .
or separate themselves amicably .
- Okay , that &apos;s how I do it .
- You should .
- I think that went well .
- Me too .
we are always talking here about the fact that we should take our time for ourselves .
I was at a dance class .

the teacher thought I have talent .
really silly , but she said .

I am married .

not really , he never comes . That &apos;s not his thing .
but whose thing is that ?
we don &apos;t come here for fun .
nothing against you .
I like you all .
Marjorie , you .
So , Sam ...
Sam is ... He had a good week .
but the thing is that , I was in the bar and probably for the first time since Sam &apos;s diagnosis I had no worries or fear .
I just had fun with these alien people who don &apos;t have the least to do with autism .
and again , I like you .
but this guy , this bartender is like that ....
his life is so crazy and daring and normal . Do you know ?

Step one : be megacharmant .
Julia , Roald Amundsen , during his expedition through the Antarctica , Julia , Roald Amundsen fed weak sled dogs to strong ones during his expedition through the Antarctic , so that it progresed faster .
- He has made them cannibals .
what is your favorite food ?
Step two : find out what annoys her about her boyfriend .
but proceed subtly .
Julia , what are Miles &apos; three biggest weaknesses ?
You can also like to name more than three .
and step three , the most important of all :
strawberries covered with chocolate .

and it would need empirical proof .
for example , her panties on the floor of my kitchenette .
this is anecdotal and pseudo-scientific .
get the fucking berries .
cool shirt .
the Pharcyde .
I saw them live in 1996 .
I was the whitest guy in the audience .
They are certainly the whitest everywhere .

Well , she tells you .
Hello , Nick here .
there is no one on it .
Hello everyone ?
- So you don &apos;t help me ?
- Sorry , I can &apos;t .
Thank you anyway .
Do you know why Evan flew from school ?
- Surely we do not know .
- But there are a lot of rumors .
it was said he sold the band Meth , so it &apos;s so bad .
I heard he was sleeping with CourtneyBsMom , and Courtney A saw her .
I heard on Halloween he went as a wolf and tore a sheep .
- That is not true .
- Some eat disgusting stuff .
it must have been bad , he was arrested .
- Arrested ?
- Yes .
were you not know ?
- Casey is only in tienth .
- Yes , I forgot that .
the superstar is still a baby .
little baby .
Evidence is important for scientific discoveries .
Yo , Arlo .
but to really understand something , you have to ask questions .
Sorry .
I am the boy whose sister beat you .
you kissed Henry yesterday , and today you kiss Arlo .
I wanted to ask how did he get you around ?
please be as concrete as possible .
Age , what is that ?
Bailey is the perfect test person as she is a slut .
you are researching how to relax women ?
- Ingenious .
- Arlo , be nice .
- Do you want a flat ?
- Nailing ?
- I don &apos;t think so .
what are you doing ?
- No , he means Pussys .
I don &apos;t like cats .
I mean , cats are quite okay .
I like birds than cats . Especially the flightless birds are cool .
Which girls are you standing on ?
or do you want to pop flightless birds ?
of course not .
a person , a human girl .
- That &apos;s enough , people .
They think I don &apos;t notice when they laugh at me , but I do .
I just don &apos;t always know why , which somehow makes it worse .
Just read it out .
we keep it to ourselves .
does he come along with a girl like Bailey ?
Trust me , man .
who is it ?
we keep it to ourselves , right ?
Come on , say .
- Tell us .
- Who is the happy one ?
Let &apos;s go .
Man , leave him alone .
he is not quite together .
Adelie- , Zügel- , Kaiser- , Eselspinguin .
Adelie- , Zügel- , Kaiser- , Eselspinguin .
Sweetieare ?
- Hey , is everything all right ?
- No .
I had to pick him up .
there was an incident .
he has not yet said a word yet .
he has locked himself .
- No idea what &apos;s going on .
- We can get that .
Sam , can I come in ?
Honey , thank God .
Are you fine ?
I want to talk to Dad .
really ?
clear .
safe .
of course .
we get each other lately .
you wanted that ?
yes , that &apos;s great .
very nice .
- Loading ... About
- Pick your card in the bar .
and when you &apos;re back , we are either better or we really need you .
- Call when you need me .
what happened at school ?
yes .
- Do you want to talk about it ?
now ?
I have , as you said , I made a plan to steal a woman .
these were not exactly my words .
I just researched , and these guys laughed at me and asked questions , I don &apos;t know what was so funny .
They laughed more and more , and then Bailey ...
I am all together .
really .
I know that .
some kids are assholes , Sam .
that &apos;s just like that .
but even the assholes get girlfriends .
everyone is easy , only I do not .
that is not true .
Believe me , it &apos;s hard for everyone .
not for you .
you stretched out Mom the guy with the jeep .
I probably presented this too simple .
when your mom got rid of the idiot , she let me flash off ten times . Okay ?
that &apos;s how it works .
but one must not give up .
so I could make a girl like me ?
of course .
then I need strawberries covered with chocolate .
Hey , Mr. Freigeist .
once again climbed up mountains again ?
I &apos;m sorry .
I have confused you .
I forgot my card here .
Elsa Gardner .
Gardner .
Please .
yes , this is my card .
great .
yes , that &apos;s why I was here , so ...
Sorry .
Is Nick there ?
- Is Nick there ?
- He must be somewhere here .
All right , you get out now and give the girl the strawberries .
then it is on the turn .
you have done what you could .
get them .
yes , that &apos;s why we are here .
No , no .
No , Sam .
Sam .
No , Sam .
Sam .
- What are you doing ?
- What do you think ?
it is illegal to enter through windows .
I could not ring .
her boyfriend has strange working hours . She doesn &apos;t like to ring because he could sleep .
one of its rules .
I like rules .
so things are clear .
before I do anything , I want to know all the rules .
your friend ?
which teenagers live together ?
Julia is not a teenager .
It is 26 years and three quarters .
Julia , your therapist ?
Let &apos;s disappear .
come out .
go , we drive .
Let &apos;s go .
in the animal kingdom , attraction is a simple , biological fact .
we have to leave .
only people make it complicated .
Wow , this is a great garden .
you could set up a pool .
Adjustable pools are cheap .
you can build a terrace around it , then it is almost like a real pool .
that &apos;s all I have to say about pools .
but ... Do you want to say something ?
okay .
why did you fly from school ?
what ?
that &apos;s you . Everyone tells something else .
What did you do ?
stole the car by the director ?
- Made in the laboratory coke ?
- No . - What happened then ?
- It doesn &apos;t matter .
is eternal .
- It plays a role for me .
- Why ?
I have enough trouble , and with you I could get it .
- Why don &apos;t you tell me ?
- It is stupid .
- Okay , go home .
- Come on .
I stole a tuba .
what ?
I stole a tuba .
and a trumpet .
and then some saxophones .
I broke into the rehearsal room and had a few instruments go with me .
I wanted to move them .
I had no good reason to do so .
the rehearsal room was not completed .
that was the reason .
anyway , no matter .
90 minutes later the cops were with me and handcuffed me .
and since I ingeniously stole the stuff out of my own school , I flew out .
that &apos;s it .
that was . I hope you &apos;re satisfied .
is that your seriousness ?
you were taking musical instruments ?
- You did ?
- I said it is stupid .
- Why do you laugh ?
- Because this is for shooting .
because everyone thinks you are a blatant daredevil .
- How did you dragged them away ?
- With my hand cart .
that is getting better and better .
I don &apos;t think you to laugh me out .
I should not have said it .
- I have to pick up my sister .
- I didn &apos;t want to ...
- Evan , wait .
- What ?
I know .
I should go .
this is really unfavorable timing , but I ...
yes , you should .
- Yes .
go .
- Yes .
the arrow was pointed and sharp .
one might think that there are regulations that prohibit such a thing in public .
they are generally dangerous , aren &apos;t they ?
absolute .
Alcoholic people fire weapons through the area .
that &apos;s dangerous , isn &apos;t it ?
- Yes ?
- I do not arrive ... - What ?
- Well , your top is in the way .
of course .
then let &apos;s go .
okay .
I make wound ointment on it .
that has expired .
so what will not get bad .
yes , they only have so much space on these small tubes that they indiscriminately print up unnecessary information .
I have never met anyone like you .
and that was .
You can get dressed .
we should exchange numbers .
in case of side effects of the expired ointment .
Listen to you should forget the thing with Julia .
why ?
on the one hand , it is much older than you .
and when you tell her what you feel , it is a conflict of interest , and she can no longer be your therapist .
- But I need her as a therapist .
then look for someone of your age .
a kind of practice friend before I date Julia .
so I would not call that .
before Roald Amundsen crossed the Antarctica , he made practice tours in simpler terrain .
that is only logical .
if I have enough experience with other girls , Julia becomes my girlfriend and is no longer my therapist .
or you could find a girl of your age .
that would be ideal for you .
and these girls will like you .
this is a good advice , thank you .
at any time .
Hey , Dad , will you tell Mom that with Julia ?
- Do you want that ?
- No , thank you .
well , then that stays with us .
I don &apos;t want to say , but I had a really good day with Sam .
he is a good boy .
- What happened to your arm ?
- Nothing . That was a nail in the garage .
show him to me , then I will beat him in .
- Did you done something on it ?
- Yes , wound ointment .
It had expired , but ...
the stuff is not really going on .
it only loses effect .
what is it for ?
because I &apos;m such a good dad ?
- Yes , you are Superdad .
- Yes ? - Am I get a cape with the title ?
- Not now .
turn off the light .
human behavior is less like that of a chicken than that of an albatross .
no matter how far he flies , he always returns home .
except , it flies too close over the water and is eaten by a tiger shark .
