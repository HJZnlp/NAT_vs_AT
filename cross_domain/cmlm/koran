this , because you have taken Allah &apos;s Ayat to mock and the earthly life deceived you , so that day , they neither go out of him ( fire ) , nor are they satisfied .
then all praise is due to Allah , to the LORD the heavens , and to the LORD of the earth , the LORD of all creation .
and to Him belongs glory in the heavens and on earth ; and He is The Blessed , The Wise .

the successively sending of Scripture is of ALLAH , The Worone , The All-Wise .
We did not create the heavens , the earth , and what is between them , except according to the law and the set time limit ; and those who pursued Kufr are away from what they were warned of .
Say : &quot; Have you seen what you are judging to instead of ALL supplictions ? show me what they created from the earth !
or do they have an participation in the heavens ? bring me a scripture before this ( Quran ) or something left of knowledge , should you be true . &quot;
and no one is erane than he who , instead of Allah , addresses supplication to what does not hear him until the Day of Resurrection ; and they are heedless to their supplication .
and when men are gathered , they will be enemies for them , they will also be kufrbeting to their servants .
and when Our Ayat are presented to them as clear , those who have pursued Kufr say to the truth after she came to them : &quot; this is a clear magic . &quot;
or do they say , &quot; He invented him ? &quot;
Say : &quot; If I had invented him , you would not be able to do anything for me before ALLAH !
<unk> knows better what <unk> <unk> <unk> him .
Allah <unk> <unk> witness between me <unk> you <unk>
and He is The Forgiving , The Gracious . &quot;
say , &quot; I was not a news among the messengers , and I do not know neither what is done with me , nor with you .
I only follow what is given to me as Wahy , and I am nothing more than a clear warner . &quot;
Say , &quot; How do you see it ? should he be of Allah , and you do it to Kufr . &quot;
and a witness of the children of Israel testified to his equal , then he internalized Iman while you have risen in arrogance . Certainly , Allah does not quite guide the unjustly -@ comitting people .
and those who practiced Kufr said to those who internalized the Iman : &quot; If he were something good , they would not have preceded us to him . &quot;
and since they found no guidance through him , they will say , &quot; This is an old Ifk g@ lie . &quot;
and before him the Scripture of Musa was an Imam and a grace ; and this is an affirmative scripture in Arabic , that he might warn those who committed injustice , and be a joyful news for the Muhsin .
certainly , those who said , &quot; Our Lord is Allah , &quot; then behaved , there is no fear of them , nor will they be sad .
these are the companions of Janna , in which they remain forever as retribution for what they used to do .
and WE instructed man to prove Ihsan to his parents ; his mother was pregnant with him in strength and gave him birth to effort .
and ( the time ) of pregnancy with him and his weaning is thirty months .
then , when he attained his maturity and was forty years old , he said , &quot; My LORD !
Give me that I am thankful to Your benefit , which YOU have granted me and my parents , and that I may do good pleasing God God what YOU are pleased , and may godly grant me good with my descendants !
yes ! I regretted of You and certainly I am of the Muslims . &quot;
these are the ones of whom WE accept the best of what they did and look at their mistroneous deeds of WE with the companions of the Janna .
and who told his parents , &quot; Pfui for you !
you promise me that I will be brought forth , and the generations have already passed before me . &quot;
and both call ALLAH for help and say , &quot; Your decline !
To internalize the Iman ! The promise of Allah is certainly true . &quot;
then he says , &quot; This is nothing but the legends of the former . &quot;
these are the ones against whom was what was said , under Umam , who already passed before them , from the Jinn and the men .
and for both there are positions for what they did , and He will reward them for their deeds , and no injustice will be done to them .
and on the day when those who have operated Kufr are exposed to the fire : &quot; You have consumed your Tay -@ yibat in your life on this side and have enjoyed it , today the torishment of humiliation is rewarded to you because of how you wrongly rise in arrogance on earth , and because of how you used to do Fisq . &quot;
and mention the brother of &apos; Aad , when he warned his people in Al --@ ahqaf , and already the warners passed away before him and behind him : &quot; serve nothing more than Allah ! yes ! I fear for you the punishment of a mighty day . &quot;
they said , &quot; Did you come to us from our gods ?
then bring us what you threaten us , should you be of the truthful . &quot;
he said , &quot; The knowledge is only with Allah . and I proclaim to you that with which I was sent , but I see you as people who are ignorant . &quot;
and when they saw it as a rain cloud over their valleys , they said , &quot; This is a rain cloud that will rain over us . &quot;
no , but it is what you have demanded a hurry , a wind that is a painful punishment ,
he destroys all things , with the instruction of his Lord .
then they became so that nothing other than their dwellings is seen and in this way We repay the severely missing people .
and certainly , We already consolidated them , whereupon We did not strengthen you , and We made them heard , eyes and intellect ; but neither their hearing , nor their eyes , nor their intellect used them anything where they denied Allah Ayat ; and they surrounded what they used to mock .
and certainly , We already destroyed what is around you in villages , and clarified the Ayat that they might reverse .
and would have helped them those who took themselves as approachers as deities instead of ALLAH !
no , but they have lost them , and this is their Ifk -@ lie and what they used to invent .
and when We turned to you a group of the Jinn who listened to the Quran , and when they were present at him , they said , &quot; Listen ! &quot;
and then , when it was stopped , they returned to their people as an end of warning .
<unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> !
certainly we heard a writing sent down to Musa , confirming what was before her , leading to the truth and right to a straightforward path .
Our people ! follows ALLAHs Da &apos;wa --@ Making and internalizes the Iman to Him . He forgives you your deeds and protects you from painful punishment .
and whoever does not follow Allah Da &apos;&apos;wa --@ mach, does not to create ( ALLAH ) on earth , and he has no wali instead of Him .
did they not see that Allah , who created the heavens and the earth and did not tire because of their creation , has the omnipotence to enliven the dead ?
Yet , for sure ! surely He is omnipotent above everything .
and on the day when those who have done Kufr are subjected to the fire : &quot; Is this not the truth ? &quot; they said , &quot; Yes , for sure , with our Lord ! &quot;
he said , &quot; so learn the punishment for what you used to do on Kufr . &quot;
so be patient , as Ulul- &apos;azm of the messengers were patiently , and demand no haste with them .
for them , it is the day they see what they are threatened , as if they have not stayed for more than an hour during the day .
this is a message . Are destroyed other than the fisq and @ operating people ? !
to those who operated Kufr and held it from Allah &apos;s way , He let their actions be lost .
and to those who internalized Iman , have done good pleasing to God , and internalized the Iman to the was sent down to Muhammad - and it is the truth of their Lord - He reinguched their deeds of God deeds and improved their situation .
This is because those who pursued Kufr followed him who were declared vvoid , and those who internalized Iman followed the true of their Lord , so ALLAH shapes men their parables .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> improve <unk> situation .
and He will let them enter Janna , which He made known to them .
<unk> <unk> <unk> internalized <unk> man <unk>
when you help Allah ( Din ) , He help you and strengthen your feet .
and for those who operated Kufr , there is decay , and He let their actions be lost .
this , because they were averse to what ALLAH sent down , He made their actions nullified .
have they not gone about on earth , that they may see how the next of those was before them ?
Allah dropped annihilation upon them , and for the Kafir there is the same .
this , because ALLAH is certainly the Maula of those who internalized the Iman , and there is certainly no Maula for the Kafir .
Indeed , Allah lets those those who have internalized Iman and have pledone good to God enter Jannat who have flowed by rivers , and those who have operated Kufr have have fun and eat as An &apos;am eat , and the fire is a residence for them .
and how many villages that were even more powerful than your place that drove you , WE were destroyed , so there is no accompanying one for them .
is the one who has clarity from his Lord , like the one to whom the evil of his doings was made beautiful ? but they followed their inclinations .
( is for example ) the parable of the Janna , which was promised the Muttaqi - there are rivers with non-perishable water , rivers with milk , the taste of which never changes , rivers with the drinking tasting wine , and rivers with filtered honey .
and for them there is in ein of all the fruits and forgiveness of their Lord , like the one who abides in the fire for ever ? and they were soaked with boiling water , and it tore their intestines .
and among them are some who listen to you , then after they had left you , they said to those who were given the knowledge , &quot; What did he say earlier ? &quot;
these are those whose hearts ALLAH sealed . and they followed their inclinations .
and those who found guidance He increased guidance and granted them their Taqwa .
are they waiting for something other than the hour to suddenly come to them ?
so already came their signs . and how will they remember when she ( the hour so ) comes to them ? !
so realize it by knowledge that there is certainly no deity except ALLAH , and ask forgiveness for your misconduct and for the momin -@ men and momin -@ women ! and ALLAH knows your travel around and your accommodation .
and those who internalized Iman say , &quot; would a Sura be sent down ! &quot;
and when a clear Sura was sent down and in it the fight was mentioned , you saw those in whose hearts are illness , look at yourself like the rigidity of the one who becomes unconscious during death .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> !
Obedience and approved word ( is better for them ) , and if the matter becomes serious , they would become true , it would be better for them .
would you , if you take responsibility , cause ruin on earth and break your ties of kinship ?
These are the ones who cursed Allah , so He made them deaf and blind He made their eyes .
don &apos;t they think about the Quran ? ! or are there locks on ( some ) hearts ? !
certainly , those who turned their backs after the guidance became visible to them , Satan makes it easy for them and made them hopes .
this , because they were certainly averse to those who were averse to what Allah gradually sent down , &quot; We will obey you in some of the matter . &quot; and ALLAH knows their secrets .
and how ( are they ) , when the angels moved their ( souls ) , they beat their faces and their backs ?
this , because they followed what provoked the wrath of Allah ; and they were averse to His pleasure , so He dropped their actions .
or did those in whose hearts are sickness think that Allah will never bring forth their resentment ?
and if We wanted it , surely We would have shown you them , then you will surely recognize them by their characteristics , and you recognize them by the hint with what what was said .
<unk> <unk> <unk> actions <unk>
and WE will examine you so that We may identify the jihad -@ perers among you and those who are patiently , and that We may examine your affairs .
Certainly those who operated Kufr have prevfrom Allah &apos;s way and resisted the Messenger enger after the guidance became visible to them , harm ALLAH in nowhere , and He will let their actions be destroyed .
<unk> <unk> <unk> internalized <unk> man <unk>
obey Allah and obey the Messenger and do not let your actions become void !
certainly , to those who operated Kufr and held them from Allah &apos;s way , then died while they were Kafir , ALLAH will never forgive them .
so do not give in and do not call to reconciliation , and you are the superior , and Allah is with you , and He will surely never diminish your actions .
the earthly life is only nonsense ; @ activity and pleasure ! and if you internalize the Iman and Taqwa , he gives you your reward and does not demand your fortune from you .
and when He asks for it , and then goes with you to the border , you will stingy , and He will bring forth your resentment .
there you are called to donate fi -@ sabilillah , and among you there are those who will stink .
but whoever stingy is only stingy towards himself .
and ALLAH is the absolute Autarke and you are the poor .
and if you turn your back , He exchanges for other people , they will not be your equal .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> clear victory ,
that Allah may forgive you what happened and will still take happen from your error , complete His benefit to you , guide you on a straightforward path .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> victory .
He is the one who sent down the hearts of the mumin &apos;s peace of heart so that they may gain more Iman to their man , and Allah include the helpers of the heavens and the earth , and ALLAH is always omniscient , all-wise .
he will let the Moomin , -@ men and the Moomin -@ women enter Jannat flowed by rivers as the Eternal in it , and wipe out their God-maldue deeds , and this is always a tremendous success at ALLAH .
and He will meet the Munafiq y -@ @ men and the Munafiq -@ women and the Muschrik men and the Muschrik -@ women who think about ALLAH bad thinking .
and Allah was angry them , cursed them , and prepared Jahannam for them ; and she is pathetic as becoming .
and ALLAH belong the helants of the heavens and the earth . and ALLAH is always all worthy , all-wise .
certainly , We sent you as witnesses , bearers of good news and warners ,
so that you may internalize Iman of Allah and His Messenger , assist His ( Din ) , glorifies Him and praises Him after sunrise and before sunset .
Indeed , those who afford you to Bai &apos;a actually face Bai &apos;a ALLAH Allah reaffirms their handshake ; whoever breaks him breaks only against himself , and whoever fills what he has committed himself to ALLAH will give him a reward huge reward .
those left behind from the desert Arabs will tell you : &quot; We occupied our fortune and our families , so for forgiveness for us ! &quot;
they say with their tongues what is not in their hearts .
Say : &quot; Who has something of ALLAH for you if He wants to be harmful to you , or wants something useful for you ? &quot;
no , but ALLAH is knowledgeable about what you do .
no , but you thought that the messenger and the mumin will never return to their families , and this was made beautiful in your hearts , you have thought the bad thinking , and you were lost people .
and whoever does not internalize the Iman of ALLAH and His Messenger , We prepared lucky heat for the Kafir .
and Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth . He forgives to whom He pleills , and He torments whom He wills ; and Allah is always forgiving , gracious .
those left behind will say , &quot; If you go to the prey goods to take them , let us follow you ! &quot;
ALLAH said forehand . &quot; then they will say , &quot; No , but you envy us . &quot;
no , but they used not to understand except a little .
say to those left behind by the desert Arabs : &quot; You are called to people of fierce violence , you fight against them or they become Muslims .
and when you obey , ALLAH gives you a beautiful reward , and when you turn your back , as you have turned your back before , He subjects you to a painful punishment . &quot;
neither for the blind it is a transgression , nor for the lame it is a misconduct , nor for the sick it is a misconduct . And whooobeys Allah and His messenger , He will let enter into Janat , which are crossed by rivers ; and whooever turns his back , He He torses a torful torment .
certainly , ALLAH is already satisfied with the Mumin , when they gave you Bai &apos;a under the tree , then He knew what is in their hearts , then He sent the heart &apos;s rest over them and rewarded them a close victory .
and many prey goods that they will take . and ALLAH is always omthworthy , all-wise .
Allah promised you many prey goods that you take , so He accelerated them to you and held the hands of the people of you , so that this would become an Aya for the mumin , and He would guide you to a straight path .
also others ( He promised you ) , over whom you had no power , which ALLAH already all-encompassing , and ALLAH is always omnipotent above everything .
and if those who have done Kufr would fight against you , they would certainly turn their backs fleeing , then they find neither Wali , nor Beiing .
this is ALLAH &apos;s approach , which has already been applied , and you will find no deviation from ALLAH &apos;s actions .
and He is the one who held their hands back from you , as well as your hands from them in the midst of the Makkah fur-@ valley , after He had made you win over them .
and ALLAH is always seeing about what you do .
they are the ones who operated Kufr and held you from Almasjidil -@ haram and prevented the sacrificial animals from reaching their destination .
and there would be no momin , -@ men and momin -@ @ women - whom you do not know you would come down without knowledge and then meet you because of damaging ( He did not hold your hands from them ) , so that ALLAH may enter into His grace whom He wills .
and if they had separated apart , WE would certainly have subjected those of them who operated Kufr to painful punishment .
( and recall ) , when those who practiced Kufr held in their hearts the rejected rejected , the negative pride of the Jahiliya , then ALLAH sent rest of their heart from Him to His envoy and to the Moomin and committed them to the word of the Taqwa , and they had more right to it and were his people .
and ALLAH is always omniscient about everything .
Certainly ALLAH truthfully ily preserved the dream face to His messenger . You will enter after all , inscha -@ allah , Almasjidil -@ haram , safely with shaved heads or with short-cut ( hair ) .
You will not be afraid , so did He know what you do not know , then He made a near victory after this .
He is the One who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the Din of truth so that He may let him surpass all Din , and ALLAH is sufficient as a witness .
Muhammad is Allah &apos;s messenger ! and those with him are hard on the Kafir , merciful to each other .
you see them as Ruku and Sujuexecuters , they strive for favor of Allah and pleasure .
their features are in their faces of the Sudschud -@ effect .
This is their parable in At --@ taurat , as well as their parable in the Alindschil . It is like a plant that drove its shoots , then it strengthened them , then they became firm , then they stood straight on their stems , it delights the sowers , so that He excites with them the Kafir .
Allah promised forgiveness and huge reward to those of them who have internalized Iman and have done good pleasing to God .

does not prejudge e ALLAH and His Messenger , and acts towards Taqwa according to ALLAH ! surely ALLAH is hearing , omniscient .

do not raise your voices above the voice of the prophet , and are not as loud to him with what is said as some of you are loud to others , otherwise your actions will be destroyed while you do not notice .
Certainly , those who dampen their voices before Allah &apos;s envoys are those whose hearts ALLAH tested for the Taqwa , for whom is forgiveness and reward huge reward .
Certainly , those who call you from beyond the Hujurat , most of them do not understand .
and if they had practiced in patience until you come out to them , this would certainly be better for them ; and ALLAH is forgiving , all-gracious .

when a Fasiq comes to you with a message , make sure that you do not hurt people by ignorance , and then you become repentant for what you have done .
and know that among you Allah is the messenger ; if he would listen to you in many of the matters , you would certainly suffer inconvenience . but ALLAH let you love the Iman and made him appear beautiful in your hearts , and has made the Kufr , the Fisq and the resistance abhor you ; these are the true reasoned .
it is a favor of ALLAH and benefit . and ALLAH is omniscient , all-wise .
and should two groups of the mumin fight themselves , then she reconciles with each other ! and should one of them commit transgression against the other , then fight the one who transforms until she returns to ALLAH &apos;s instruction . and when she then returned , then both reconcile for justice and be righteous ! certain , ALLAH loves the righteous .
the mumin are siblings , so reconcile your siblings with each other ! and act towards Taqwa according to Allah , so that you may show mercy .
you who have internalized the Iman ! Neither men should make fun of ( other ) men - maybe they are better than them , nor women about ( other ) women - maybe they are better than them . and do not make each other bad and do not give yourself dirty names ! pathetic is the Fisq --@ name after the Iman . and those who do not regret it , they are the injustice -@ Beders .
you who have internalized the Iman ! Avoid the most from speculating !
Certainly , some speculation is a misconduct , and do not spy , and some of you should not commit Ghibah against the others !
may the one of you feed on the flesh of his dead brother ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and acts to Taqwa according to ALLAH ! Certainly ALLAH is reue disp-@ accepting , gracious .

certainly , We created you from a male and a feminine , and made you peoples and tribes , so that you might know each other .
certainly , the digniest of you at ALLAH is the one with the most Taqwa .
certainly , ALLAH is omniscient , knowledgeable .
the desert guards said , &quot; We internalized Iman . &quot;
Say : &quot; You have not internalized the Iman , but say , &quot; We have been Muslims , &quot; but the Iman has not yet penetrated into your hearts .
and if you obey Allah and His messenger , He will not suppmit anything to you from your actions . &quot; Certainly Allah is forgiving , , gracious .
the mumin are only those who internalized the Iman of ALLAH and His messenger , then had no doubt , and jihad with their fortune and gave themselves fi -@ sabilillah , who are the truthful .
Say : &quot; Do you want to teach ALL about your Din ?
and ALLAH knows what is in the heavens and what is on earth . &quot; and Allah is omniscient about everything .

Say : &quot; Make me no reproaches because of your Islam ! no , but ALLAH showed you grace that he guided you to Iman , you should be truthful . &quot;
Certainly Allah knows the hidden of the heavens and the earth ; and Allah is seeing of what you do .

no , but they were amazed that a warner from them came to them , so the Kafir said , &quot; This is something amazing !
if we died and became earth , ( will we return ) ?

We already knew what the earth was taking away from them , and with Us there is a preserving scripture .
no , but they denied the true when it came to them , so they are in a confused situation .
have they not looked at the sky above them , as We built and adorned him , and he has no cracks ?
and We extended the earth , put clenones in them , and sprouted upon it from every pleasing duality ,
as an insight at -@ guarantee and reminder for every recurring servant .
and We gradually dropped water full of Baraka from the sky , then We let Jannat and harvested grains sprout out .
as well as high date palms that bear tup-like fruits ,
as Rizq for the servants . and thus WE animated a dead village .
denied in front of them have the people of Nuh , the inhabitants of Ar wive-@ rass and Thamud
and &apos; Aad , Pharaoh and the brothers of Lut
as well as the inhabitants of Al , -@ aika , and the people of Tubba &apos; ; all accused the envoys of falsehood , so My threat was right .
were WE overwhelmed by the first creation ? ! no , but they are in confusion before a new creation .
and surely We already created men and WE know what his soul whispers to him , and WE are closer to him than his carotid artery .
when the two recipients receive sitting from the right and from the left .
he does not utter a word without him being a supervisor present .
and the daze , -@ Making of death came truthfully ; this is what you were averse to .
and it was pushed into Ace , -@ sur . This is the day of the threat .
and every soul came , with her , a guide , and a witness .
certainly , if you were already careless , however , then we took away your cover from you , then your vision is sharp today .
and his ( close ) companion said , &quot; That &apos;s what I have . &quot;
&quot; Throw every extremely stubborn Kufr nor-@ operator , both of both in Jahannam ,

on the day when We say to Jahannam , &quot; Have you become full ? ! &quot;
and she says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
and the Jannah was brought closer to the Muttaqi without being far .
this is what has been promised to you , for every preserving reversal ,
who had reverence for the all-gracious and came with a repent heart .
&quot; enters them with Salam . This is the day of eternity . &quot;
for them it is determined in what they want . and with Us is even more .
and how many WE destroyed them before on generations who were even more fiercely violent than they were , then they sought in the countries whether there was an escape .
Certainly , there is an admonition for the one for whom there was an mind , or who listened while he was a witness .
and certainly , We created already the heavens , the earth and what is between them in six Ay --yyam , and Us did not overcome any fatigue .
then exercise yourselves in patience to what they say , and praise the praise of your Lord before the sunrise and before the sunset .
and in a part of the night praise Him and after Sujud !
and listen on the day when the calling calls out of a near place .
on the day when they hear the cry truthfully , this is the day of the occurrence .

then he put it up to them , he said , &quot; Do you not eat ? &quot;
then he hid fear from them . They said , &quot; Do not be afraid ! &quot;
and they gave him joyful news about an extremely knowledgeable boy .
then his wife came in loud exuberance , slapped her face and said , &quot; I am a barren old man ! &quot;
they said , &quot; This is what your Lord said . Surely He is The Wise , The Omniscient . &quot;
he said , &quot; What is your desire , you messengers ? &quot;

then he turned to his protectors and said , &quot; ( he is ) a magician or mentally disturbed . &quot;
then We punished him with his soldiers , then We threw them into the river , while he was reprehensible .
and with &apos; Aad ( there was an Aya ) when We sent the barren wind over them ,
who leaves none of what he blew over , without making it crushed .
and with Thamud ( there was an Aya ) when they were told , &quot; Have fun only until a time ! &quot;

&quot; So escape to Allah ! surely I am a clear warner for you before Him .

is this magic , or don &apos;t you see ? !
step into it , then be patient patient or do not be patient , it is equal for you ; you will only be rewarded what you used to do . &quot;
Certainly , the Muttaqi are in Jannat and well-being ,
rejoice at what their LORD granted them , and their LORD protected them from the punishment of hell .
&quot; eat and drink carefully for what you used to do . &quot;
they are based on strung loungers . and WE had them married with Hur- &apos; in .
and to those who internalized Iman , and whose descendants followed them with Iman , We sent after their descendants , and We diminished nothing from their doings .
and WE provided them with fruit and meat of what they desire .
they give each other mugs , with which is neither pointless talk nor the missing .
and serve them their servants , who were like pearls kept in shells .
<unk> <unk> of them turned <unk> <unk> <unk>
they said : &quot; Surely we used to be awesome --beforehand with our families ,
then ALLAH showed us grace and protected us from the punishment of the heat .
Certainly we used to address Him supplications beforehand . Surely He is The Most Good , The Merciful .
for you are neither a divineller nor a disturbed of mind because of the benefit of your Lord .
or say , for example , &quot; he is a poet with whom we wait for a dubious end . &quot;
Say , &quot; Just wait , for I am with you from those waiting . &quot;
or do their forbearance require this ? or are they transgressing people ?
or <unk> <unk> <unk> invented <unk> ! &quot;
no , but they do not internalize the Iman .
then they shall bring a report of his peers , should they be truthful .
or were they created by nothingness ? or were they themselves the creators ? !
or did they create the heavens and the earth ?

or are the magazines of your Lord with them ? or are they the controllers ? !
or is there a ladder for them to listen to ? !

so those who operated Kufr are the ones against whom List is planned .
or is there a deity for them except ALLAH ? !
subhanallah about what they do Schirk .
and when they see fragments falling from the sky , they say , &quot; These are overlayered clouds . &quot;
then leave them until they meet their day when they are slain .
on the day when they are not used by their cunning or assisted .
and certainly , for those who went wrong , there is a punishment after this , but most do not know .
and exercise patience , to the instruction of your Lord ; for you are certainly under Our supervision ; and praise the praise of your Lord , when you rise ,
and on a part of the night praise Him , and after fading the stars .

they only follow speculation , and speculation replaces truth in nothingness .
so turn away from the one who turns away from Our exhortation and wants exclusively the life of this side .

certainly , your Lord knows better about the one who strayed from His way , and He knows better about the one who found guidance .
and Allah belongs to what is in the heavens and what is on earth ; he will repay to those who did evil , but what they did , and He will reward those who did Him san with the better .
they are those who avoid the severity of transgressions and abominations except the trifles ; surely your Lord is of all-embracing forgiveness .
He knows better about you than He let you forth from the earth , and when you were embryos in the bellies of your mothers , do not praise your self !

and when they see an Aya , they turn away and say , &quot; This is a lasting magic . &quot;
and they denied and followed their inclinations . and every affair has an end point .

it is an attaining wisdom . and what good are the warnings ? !

on the day when the person of the call calls to something disapproved -
their eyes are humbled , they come out of the graves as if they were warming locusts ,
Kafir say , &quot; This is a rather difficult day . &quot;
before them denied the people of Nuh , so they accused Our servant of falsehood and said , &quot; He is spiritually disturbed and was possessed . &quot;
then he supplicted to his LORD , &quot; I am inferior , and stand by . &quot;
then We opened to you gates of heaven with poured masses of water ,
and WE let springs spring from the earth , then the water met for a matter that was already determined ,
and WE carried him on some of planks and nails .
it drove under Our supervision in retaliation for the one who used to run Kufr .
and certainly We already left it as an Aya ! is there a remembering ? !
so how were My punishment and My admonitions ? !
and certainly , We already facilitated the Quran for exhortation . Is there a remembering ? !

they will know tomorrow who the boastful liar is .
certainly , WE will send the female camel as Fitna for her , so wait for her and practise yourself even more in patience !
and tell them that the water will be divided between them ; every share of drinking is only for those present .
then they called their companion , then he took ( the sword ) , then he injured their legs .
so how were My punishment and My admonitions ? !
Certainly , WE sent a single cry about them , then they were like the stubble for the stable owner .
and certainly , We already facilitated the ururan for admonition ! is there a remembering ? !
the people of Lut denied the warnings .
Certainly , We sent over them a sandstorm except the family of Lut , these saved WE from dawn ,
as a benefit from Us . Thus We repay to the one who proves grateful .
and certainly , We already warned them of Our violence , then they doubted the warnings .
and certainly , they already tried to seduce him against his inclination and his guests , then We wiped out their eyesight .

the collection will still suffer a defeat and turn its backs back fleeing .
no , but the hour is their appointment and the hour is worse , even more bitter .

the day they are dragged in the fire on their faces , taste the touch of Saqar .

Allah praise all who are in the heavens and on earth , and He is The Blessed , The Wise .
He owns the dominion of the heavens and the earth ; he animates and lets die , and He is almighty above all .
He is the always present , the always lasting , the manifest and the inner . and He is omniscient about everything .
he is the one who created the heavens and the earth in six Ay -@ yam , then turned to Al &apos;ahrsch .
he knows what is going into the earth , what is coming out of it , what descends from heaven and what is coming up to it .

and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> what you do .
He owns the dominion of the heavens and the earth . and Allah are subject to the affairs .
He flows the night into the day and flows the day into the night , and He is omniscient about that in the breasts .
internalize the Iman to ALLAH and His Messenger and donate from what He has made you property rators .
for those of you who internalized and donated the Iman , a great reward is destined .
and why do you not internalize Iman of Allah , while the Messenger calls you to internalize the Iman of your Lord ? and He has already received your vow , should you be mumin .
he is the one who sends clear ayat to his servant , so that He may bring you out of the darkness to the light ; and certainly , ALLAH is all kind , merciful to you .
and why do you not donate fi -@ sabilillah , and Allah belongs the legacy of the heavens and the earth ?
not equal is the one of you who donated and fought before the capture ( of Mecca ) ( to one who did not ) .
these have a higher position than those who donated and fought afterwards .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> what you do .
who is he who gives ALLAH ( His thing ) a nice loan ? then He will multiply it , and for him a noble reward is intended .
the day when you see the momin -@ men and the mumin -@ women , their light runs in front of them and with their right hand : &quot; There is a happy news for you today - Jannat who are crossed by rivers , as EEternal in it . &quot;

on the day when the Munafiq -@ men and the MunMunafiq @ women to those who internalized the Iman said : &quot; Wait for us for us to benefit something from your light , &quot; it is said : &quot; Go backwards , then look for light . &quot;
then a partition wall was built between them , which has a door , inside which is grace , while outside is punsing .
they call them , &quot; were we not with you ? &quot;
they said , &quot; Yes , for sure , but you have left yourselves to Fitna , waited and doubted , and the hopes deceived to you until Allah &apos;s instruction came .
and ALLAH deceived you with the deceptive .
so today you do not receive a replacement service , nor by those who have operated Kufr .
it is your Maula . and the becoming is miserable . &quot;
Is it not yet time for those who internalized Iman , that their hearts should show reverence to Allah remembrance what was sent down by the truth , and that they will not become like those to whom the Scripture was bestowed before , then for them for the time , then their hearts became hard ?

Know that Allah certainly enlivens the earth after its death . We already explained Ayat to you , that you may understand .
Indeed , the donating men , the donating women and those who give ALLAH ( His thing ) a Hasan fu-@ bond , this it is multiplied , and for them a beautiful reward is determined .
and those who internalized Iman of Allah and His messengers , these are the utmost true , and the witnesses of their Lord ; they have their reward and their light .
and those who operated Kufr and denied Our Ayat , these are the companions of hell .
Know that earthly life is only pleasure , distraction , jewellery , importance among you and increase in wealth and children .
it resembles abundant rain whose plant growth pleases the cafir , then it dries ( the plant growth ) , and you see it turn yellow , then it becomes crushed , and in the hereafter there is hard punsing and forgiveness of ALLAH and pleasure .
but the life on this side is nothing but the consumption of deception .
competes for forgiveness from your Lord and a Janna whose breadth th is like the breadth of heaven and earth , it was prepared for those who internalized Iman of Allah and His Messenger ; this is ALLAH &apos;s favor which He grants to him whom He wants , and ALLAH is of immeasurable favor .
neither a calamity on earth , nor yourselves , without it being in a scripture before We created it . Certainly this is something easy for Allah .
lest you not mourn for that which has escaped you , and not excessively rejoice in that which has been granted to you .
and ALLAH doesn &apos;t love every important bouncer ,
those who stingy and command man avariness .
and whoever turns away is certainly ALLAH The absolute car brand , The all-prathworthy .
Certainly , We already sent Our messengers with the clear signs and sent with them the Scripture and Al vv-@ mizan so that men might exercise righteousness . and WE sent down to the iron in which there is fierce violence and useful for men , and thus makes ALLAH recognizable who assists His ( Din ) and His Messenger in secret . Indeed , ALLAH is all-ighty , all worthy .
and surely , We already sent Nuh and Ibrahim , and let in their descendants be the prophethood and the Scripture .
so some of them are guided , and many of them are Fasiq .
Then We sent Our envoys in their footsteps and sent after &apos; Isa Ibnu gou-@ Maryam and had him given Alindschil .
and We put in the hearts of those who followed him , mercy and grace , and monasticism which they invented , which We not imposed on them except in the pursuit of Allah ; but they did not keep it as he deserves .
then We gave their reward to those of them who internalized Iman , and many of them are Fasiq .
<unk> <unk> <unk> internalized <unk> man <unk>
acts with Taqwa according to ALLAH and internalizes Iman of His Messenger , then He grants you two proportions of His grace , make light for you with whom you go , and forgive you ; and ALLAH is forgiving , all-gracious .
that the owners of writers may know with certainty they have no power over any of Allah &apos;s favor , and that the favor is certainly subject to Allah , He makes them prove to whom He pleases .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> immense <unk> .
already ALLAH heard the utterance of those who disputed with you because of their husband and complained of ALLAH , and ALLAH heard your dialogue .
those of you who pronounced their wives Zihar are certainly certainly not their mothers ; surely their mothers are only those who bore them .
and certainly , they say something disapproved of what has been said and wrong . and certainly , ALLAH is true faithful -yaccepting , forgiving .
and to those who told their wives Zihar , then take back what they said ( as Kaffara ) the liberation of an unfree man , before both touch each other accurately , so you will be admonished . and Allah is knowledgeable of what you do .
so if who can not do this , he fast for two consecutive months , before both touch intimately .
and whoever cannot , he feeds sixty arms ; this so that you may internalize Iman of Allah and His Messenger .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> guidelines <unk>
and for the Kafir a painful punishment is intended .
Certainly , those who oppose Allah and His messenger were put down , as those were put down before them , and already We sent down clear Ayat .
and for the Kafir humiliating cleansing is destined .
the day they are all awakened , He will tell them about what they did .
Allah included it in detail as they forgot it , and Allah is above all witness .
have you not perceived that ALLAH knows everything that is in the heavens and on earth ?
there is neither a secret conversation of three , without He being their fourth , nor of five , without He being their sixth , nor of less than these , nor more , without He being with them , where they are ; then He will tell them of what they did on the Day of Resurrection .
certainly , ALLAH is omniscient about everything .
did you not see those who were forbidden the secret conversation , then they still return to what they were forbidden , and secretly talk about the failure , transgression and contradiction of the Messenger ?
and when they come to you , they greet you with that with which Allah did not greet you , and say within them , &quot; Allah would torment us for what we say ! &quot;
Jahannam is enough for them , they are thrown into it , so the becoming is pathetic .
<unk> <unk> <unk> internalized <unk> man <unk>
if you talk confidentially , then do not talk confidentially about the failure , the transgression and the contradiction of the Messenger ! and talk confidentially about the benevolent action and the Taqwa !
the secret conversation is only from Satan , so that those who internalized the Iman may make you sad , but he will not harm them in anything but with ALLAH &apos;s consent . and ALLAH should practice the Moumin Tawakkul .
<unk> <unk> <unk> internalized <unk> man <unk>
if you are told , &quot; Make room while sitting ! &quot; make room ! Allah may make you room .
and when you are told : &apos; get up ! &apos; then get up ! Allah exalts those of you who internalized Iman , and those who have been given knowledge for positions .
and <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> you do .

if you want to talk confidentially to the messenger , give a sadaqa before your confidential conversation !

and if you are not able , so certainly , Allah is forgiving , all gracious .
Are you afraid to admit Sadaqa before your confidential conversation ?
and if you do not do it - and ALLAH already accepted your repentance , properly perform the ritual prayer , pay the Zakat and obey ALLAH and His Messenger !
and <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> you do .
didn &apos;t you see those who took people whom ALLAH is angry when Wali ? !
they are neither of you nor of them , and they swear by the lie while they know .
Allah prepared them a painful punishment ; surely it was bad what they used to do .
they took their oaths as a shield , then they held away from Allah &apos;s way .
They will not take the use of their wealth , nor their children , before Allah , who are the companions of the fire , they remain in it forever .
on the day when He all awakens them , they will swear to Him as they swear to you , and they think they have something ( useful ) .

Satan seized them , then he made them forget Allah remembrance .

yes , undoubtedly ! the party of Satan are the real losers .
Indeed , those who oppose ALLAH and His envoy are among the humiliest .
Allah wrote : &quot; but I and My messengers will prevail . &quot; surely Allah is powerful , all worthy .
You do not find people who internalize Iman on Allah and the Last Day , love those who opposed Allah and His Messenger , not even if they were their fathers , their sons , their brothers , or their relatives .
these are those in whose hearts He wrote Iman and whom He strengthened with glory from Him .
and He causes them to enter into Janat , which are flowed by rivers , in which they are eternal .
Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him .
these are the ALLAH ( loyal ) party .
yes , undoubtedly ! the ALLAH ( loyal ) party are the real successful .
Allah praise all who are in the heavens and on earth , and He is The Blessed , The Wise .
he is the one who had those of the font owners who operated Kufr driven out of their homes for the first expulsion .
you thought not that they would come out , and they thought that their castles would protect them from Allah ; then Allah came to them from there , with which they did not reck, and cast terror into their hearts .
they destroyed their houses with their own hands and the hands of the mumin , so draw a teaching , you with insight !
and if Allah had not determined deportation to them , He would have tormented them in this world , and for them the punishment of fire is determined in the hereafter .
this , because they resisted ALLAH and His messenger , and who opposes ALLAH , certainly , ALLAH is hard in punishment .
and you have not liked a young date palm or let it stand on its roots except with Allah &apos;s approval , and so that He humiliates the Fasiq .
and what ALLAH made His Messenger of them a prey , for this you have not let horses or riding camels run , but ALLAH lets His messengers take action against those whom He pleases , and Allah is omnipotent over everything .
what made His Messenger prey a prey of the inhabitants of the villages , this is for ALLAH ( cause ) , for the messenger , for those of kinship , for the orphans , for the poor , and for the traveller in need , so that the wealth may not rotate ( only ) among the rich of you .
and what the messenger gave you , take it ; and what he forbade you , let go of it .
and acts to Taqwa according to ALLAH ! Certainly , ALLAH is hard in punishment .
it is for the hijra nor-@ entrepreneurpoor expelled from their homes and assets , they strive for favor from ALLAH and pleasure , and they help ALLAHs ( Din ) and His messenger , who are the real truthful .
and those who already inhabited the abode ( Madina ) and the Iman ( internalized ) before them , love those who undertook Hijrah to them , and they find in their breasts no desire for what was given to them ( others ) , and they prefer others before themselves , even when they are in need .
and whoever is protected from the avariness of his ego , these are the real successful ones .
and those who came after them say , Our Lord !
forgive us and our siblings , who internalized Iman before us , and leave no resentment in our hearts for those who internalized the Iman .

certainly , YOU are kind , gracious . &quot;
you have not seen those who have pursued Nifaq , they say to their brothers of the owners of the writing who operated Kufr : &quot; If you were driven out , we would certainly go away with you and would not obey anyone against you at all ; and if you would fight , we would help you ! &quot;
and Allah testifies that they are liars .
if they were driven out , they will not go away with them , and if they were fought , if they will not help them , and if they would help them , if they would turn their backs , then they will not be helped .
Certainly , you are more terrifying in their hearts than Allah .
because <unk> are people who <unk> <unk> understand <unk>
they do not fight against you together except in fortified villages or from behind walls .
you suspect them united while their hearts are different , because they are people who do not reflect .
like those before them recently , they experienced the evil consequences of their matter , and for them painful punsing is destined .
like Satan , when he said to man , &quot; run Kufr ! &quot; and after he had pursued Kufr , he said , &quot; Surely I say loose of you ; I am afraid of Allah , the LORD of all creation . &quot;
so the next of both was that they are eternal in the fire therein .
and this is the retribution of injustice at -@ Begehenden .

he is ALLAH , The Creator , The Giver to Existence , The Shaping .
everything that is in the heavens and on earth praises Him , and He is The Worone , The Wise .
you who have internalized the Iman , do not take yourselves My enemy and your enemy as Wali .
you show love to them , while they have already pursued Kufr to what came to you from the truth ; they drive out the messenger and you , because you have internalized the man of Allah your Lord .
If you should have left jihad , -@ on My way and in the pursuit of My pleasure , ( do not take it as Wali ) , you secretly tell them love , and I know better about what you conceal and what you reveal .
and whoever does it from you , he already missed the right way .
if they overm you , they will be enemies for you , and stretch their hands and their tongues against you with evil ; and they wished to do Kufr .

Allah does not forbide you those who did not fight you because of Din and did not drove you out of your dwellings , that you might meet them with goodness and treat them with righteously ; surely Allah loves the righteous .

and when they departed , Allah let their hearts deviate .
and ALLAH does &apos;t guide fisq ? -@ operating people .

Indeed , I am Allah &apos;s messenger to you confirming what was before me of At fif-@ taurat , and bringing forth a good news from a messenger coming after me whose name is Ahmad ( Promised ) . &quot;
and when he came to them with the clear signs , they said , &quot; This is an unambiguous magic . &quot;
and no one commits more injustice than the one who invented lies in the name of Allah while being invited to Islam .
and ALLAH does not quite guide the wrong , --@ committing people .
they want to extinguish Allah &apos;s light with their mouths , and Allah will make His light complete , even then , if the Kafir would be averse .

Allah praises all who are in the heavens and on the earth , The ruler , The absolutely Pure , The Worise , The Wise .

they took their oaths as a shield , then they held out from Allah &apos;s way , surely it became bad what they used to do .

and Allah will never grant to one soul postponement when its deadline came , and Allah is knowledgeable of what you do .
Allah praise all who are in the heavens , and on the earth ; He owns dominion , and He deserves all praise ; and He is almighty above all .
he is the one who created you , so some of you are Kafir and some of you are Moomin , and ALLAH is seeing all what you do .

Let them dwell where you live , after your fortune , and do not harm them to distress them .
and if they be pregnant , give them maintenance until they have given birth ; and if they bresilent for you , give them their reward .

Allah shaped a parable for those who pursued Kufr , the wife of Nuh and the wife of Lut . They both were with two servants of Our servants who were Godly pleasing good , then both ( women ) committed treason against them , then both used nothing to them ( their wives ) before ALLAH . and it was said : &quot; Enter into the fire with the entrants ! &quot;
and Allah coined a parable for those who internalized the Iman , the wife of Pharaoh , when she said , &quot; My LORD !
Build for me a house in Jannah , and deliver me from Pharaoh and his doings , and deliver me from the unrighteous people . &quot;
also Maryam Ibnatu , los-@ Imran , who kept her chastity , then We breathed into her a praise from Us ; and she considered the words of her Lord and His scriptures true , and was one of the always servants .
always more sublime is the one who holds the dominion . and He is omnipotent above everything ,
who created death and life so that He may test you who of you is better in doing , and He is The Worone , The Forgiving .
You see nothing in disharmony in the creation of the Blessed Mercy .
so look repeatedly , do you see anything about cracks ? !
then look repeatedly twice , so the look returns to you while he is overtired .
and surely We already decorated the lowest heaven with lights , and made them stoning for the Satans ; and We prepared them the punishment of the heat heat .
and for those who have done Kufr against their LORD , the punishment of Jahannam is destined ; and becoming is miserable .
when they are thrown into them , they hear shouting from them while boiling them .
Again and again when a group is thrown into them , they are asked by their representatives : &quot; did no warner come to you ? ! &quot;
they said , &quot; Yes , for sure ! already a warner came to us , then we denied us and said , &quot; Allah sent nothing down little by little , you are only in a great deception . &quot;
and they said , &quot; If we had listened or reflected , we would not be among the companions of the lucky heat . &quot;
so they admitted their misconduct . So destruction be to the companions of the heat !
Indeed , those who have reverence for their Lord in secret , for this there is forgiveness and a great reward .
and conceals or reveals your statement , surely He is omniscient about that in the breasts .
does the one who created does not possess knowledge , while He is the all-kind , the all-knowledgeable ? !
He is the one who made the earth yielding for you , so go around in their areas and eat of His Rizq ; and to Him is the awakening .
do you feel safe from Him Whose ( instruction ) in heaven is that He sinks the earth with you , and that it trembles immediately ?
or do you feel sure of Him Whose is in heaven that He sends sandstorm upon you ? so you will still know how My warning is .

did they not see over them the birds with outstretched wings , and they pull them in ?

Say : &quot; Knowledge is only with Allah , and I am just a clear warner . &quot;
and after they had seen them near , the faces of those who operated Kufr were grieved , and it was said , &quot; This is what you used to demand . &quot;
Say : &quot; How do you see it ? if ALLAH destroys me and those with me or shows grace , who gives Kafir protection from a painful punishment ? &quot;

and if he had invented something invented in Our name ,

then cut <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
so there is none of you to hold it back from him .
and surely he is an exhortation for the Muttaqi .
and surely We know that there are denials among you .
and surely he is a self-charge for the Kafir .
and surely he is the truth of certainty .
<unk> praise the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> tender asked <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
for the Kafir , for whom there is no reserved

the angels and glory ascend to Him on a yaum whose length is fifty thousand years .

Certainly , man was created as a fearful impatient .

and when good strikes him , he is extremely stingy ,

and those in <unk> assets <unk> a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> excluded ,
as well as those who consider the Day of Din to be true ,
and those who are reverently tarth--filled with the punishment of their Lord ,
Surely the punishment of their Lord is not assurable ,
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> their chastity
except before their spouses or before those who belong to them , for then they are certainly not be rebuked ,
and who also strives , these are the real transgressors ,
and those who take care of what is entrusted to them and their contracts ,
and those who <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
as well as those who perform their ritual prayers in their time ,

so what about those who have pursued Kufr , they come to you hurrying
<unk> the right and left <unk> groups <unk> <unk>
does every man of them hope that he will be let into a Janna of welfare ?

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> what <unk> know .
so I swear by the Lord the East and the West , surely We are able to do so ,
them with the better than they exchange , and We are not preceded .
and let them entertain , and commit mischief , until they meet their day , which is threatened with them .
on the day they hurry come out from the graves as if they were tracking into erected ( signs ) .
their eyes are lowered ( with awe ) , and humiliation overcomes them , this is the day they have always been threatened with .
certainly , We sent Nuh to his people , &quot; Warn your people before a painful punishment comes to them . &quot;
<unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am a clear warner for you .
serves ALLAH and acts according to Taqwa towards Him and obeys me !
he forgives you from your transgressions and grants you postponement until a set deadline . Indeed , if Allah &apos;s deadline begins , will no longer be advanced , as you would only know . &quot;
<unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk>
Certainly , I made Da &apos;wa among my people at night and during the day .
but my Da &apos;wa only strengthened them in the escape .
and again and again , when I made them Da &apos;wa , that YOU forgive them , they put their fingers in their ears , enveloped themselves with their clothes , insisted , and rose in quite arrogance .
then I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
then I revealed it to them and also told them secretly .
then I said , &quot; Ask your Lord for forgiveness ; surely He is always forgiving ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you ,
provide you with assets and children , let Jannat grow for you and let rivers flow for you .
Why are you <unk> interested in <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> He <unk> <unk> <unk> phases <unk>
do you not perceive how ALLAH created seven layered heavens on top of each other ?
and He made the moon in them as light and the sun as a lamp .
and ALLAH really let you bring forth by the earth ,
then He brings you back and He really brings you out .
and ALLAH made the earth like the unfolded ,
to build on <unk> wide <unk> . &quot;
Nu<unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Certainly , they opposed me and followed the one whose wealth and children increased him only at the loss .
and they planned <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and said , &quot; Never leave your gods , nor leave neither Wadd , nor Suwa &apos; , nor Yaghuth , Ya &apos;uq and Nasr ! &quot;
and already they tempted many . and YOU only the unongful to go wrong . &quot;
because of their misgreseds they were drowned , then brought into a fire , then they found no assimembers for themselves instead of ALLAH .
<unk> Nuh said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
leave none of the Kafir on earth .
certainly , if YOU leaves them , they entice your servants and testify nothing but an extremely kufr -@ operator who commit the misconduct publicly .
<unk> Lord <unk> <unk> <unk>
forgive me , my parents , everyone who enters my house as a mumin , the mumin men men and the mumin for -women , and do not increase the injustice -@ Beitting except of destruction . &quot;
Say : &quot; I was given as Wahy that a group was listening from the Jinn . &quot;
then they said , &quot; Surely we heard a wonderful Quran .
then we internalized Iman of him , and we will not do any shirk with anyone against our Lord . &quot;
&quot; and certainly , all have is the glory of our Lord , He took Himself neither companion , nor children . &quot;
&quot; and certainly , the limited of us used to say only deviations about ALLAH . &quot;
&quot; and certainly we thought that the people and Jinn never say about ALLAH the loe . &quot;
&quot; and certainly some men from men used to seek protection from some men from the Jinn , then they increased them in injustice . &quot;
&quot; and certainly they thought how you thought that ALLAH would not awaken anyone . &quot;
&quot; and certainly we looked for heaven , then they found full filled with strong guards and lightning flames . &quot;
&quot; and certainly we used to sit on some of his waiting to listen , whoever listens now finds a lurking lightning flame for himself . &quot;
&quot; and surely we do not know whether evil is desired for those on the earth , or whether their Lord wanted good for them . &quot;
&quot; and certainly , among us are the God-pleasing good and among us some are below this ( level ) , we belonged to different denominations . &quot;
&quot; and certainly we believed that we did not create Allah on earth and that we would not create Him by fleeing . &quot;
&quot; and certainly , when we heard the guidance , we internalized Iman of it , and he who internalizes Iman of his Lord fears neither reduction nor injustice . &quot;
&quot; and certainly , among us are Muslims and among us are unjust , and those who practiced Islam , they sought the reasonable .
and concerning the unjust , they are firewood for Jahannam . &quot;
and if they had kept the way ( Allah ) , We would have soaked them plenty of water ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Fitna .
and whoever turns from the remembrance of his Lord lets him enter into an ascending punishment .
&quot; and certainly , all mosques are for Allah , so do not address supplications to anyone beside Allah ! &quot;
&quot; and certainly , when Allah &apos;s servants arose to address supplictions to Him , they would almost be him oppressive . &quot;
Say , &quot; I only address supplictions to my Lord and do not shirk with anyone with anyone ! &quot;
Say : surely I have for you neither damaging nor good
- Say : &quot; I will not grant protection from Allah , and I will find no refuge except from Him ! &quot;
except about proclamements of ALLAH and His messages . and whoever opposes ALLAH and His messenger , certainly Jahannam is destined for him , in which they remain forever , forever .
when they saw what they were threatened , they will still know who has a weaker one and is less in number .
say , &quot; I do not know whether it is near what you are threatened with it , or whether my Lord is giving time .
He is The Omniscient of the Hidden , so He does not show His Hidden
except the one in whom He finds good pleasure as Messenger , surely He makes a watch before him and behind him ,
that he ( the Messenger ) knows that they have already delivered the message of their Lord ; and He may covered what they have , and numbered everything in detail .
Muz <unk> <unk> @ <unk> amil <unk>
perform Qiyam all night except a little ,

or add something to her , and recite the Quran in Tartil bed -@ form !

Certainly , getting up at night is heavier than obligation and better for the ( recited ) word .
Certainly , during the day you are pursuing many occupations .
and remember the name of your Lord , and dedicate yourself to Him in the dedication .
He is The Lord of the East and the West , there is no deity but Him , so take Him as Wakil !
and be patient with what they say and distance away from them at a beautiful distance !
and leave Me with the rich deniers and give them a little time !
Certainly , with Us there are heavy shackles and hell ,
and suffocating food <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the day when the earth and mountains tremble , and the mountains become scattered dunes .
surely We sent to you a Messenger testifying against you , as We sent a messenger to Pharaoh .
then Pharaoh resisted the envoy , then We prosecuted him with a serious concern .
for how do you protect yourselves , when you have pursued Kufr , from a day that brings gray hair to the children ?

surely this is an exhortation ; whoever will stritake a way to his Lord .
surely your Lord knows that you are perform Qiyam less than two-thirds of the night , half of it and one-third of it , and a group of those with you .
and Allah determines the night and the day , knowing that you cannot seize it in detail , so He forgave you .
recite this from the Quran what you are capable of .
he knew that among you will will be sick , as well as others who travel around the country , they strive for something of Allah &apos;s favor , as well as others who fight fi -@ sabilillah , so recited by what you are capable of . and carry out the ritual prayer , properly pay the Zakat and grant a Hasan --@ bond for ALLAH ( Din ) !

they are in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

they said , &quot; We used not to be of those those of ritual prayer ,
and we <unk> <unk> <unk> the needy <unk>
and we used to sweat with the senseless chattering senseless ,
and we used to deny the day of Din ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
it is not of no use to them the intercession of the cessors .

and they do not remember except if Allah wants , he is worthy of the Taqwa and worthy of forgiveness .
no , I swear by the Day of Resurrection ,
no , I also swear by the noble soul .
does man think that WE will not put his bones together ? !
Yes , for sure ! We are able to put his fingertips in order .
no , but man wants to commit transgressions in public before Him .
he asks , &quot; When is the Resurrection Day ? &quot;
<unk> <unk> <unk> eyes shine <unk>

man says on this day : &quot; Where is the escape route ? &quot;

by your LORD is the whereabode on this day .
on that day it is told to man what he presented and what he pushed up .

do not move your tongue , so that you have it faster .
We are responsible for his collection and his recitation .

they believe that they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
certainly , no ! when it ( the soul ) reaches the collarbones ,

and he <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> separation <unk>
and the leg will be beaten over the ( other ) leg ,
to your <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> day .
so he did not consider it true , nor did he perform ritual prayer ,
but <unk> <unk> <unk> turned his <unk> <unk>
then he went to his family in arrogance .
it ( evil ) came closer to you , it came closer ,
yes ! it came closer to you , it came closer ( so be careful ! ) .
does man think that he remains as something neglected ? !
he was not a nutfa of seed poured ,
then he was an &apos; Alaqa , then He ( him ) gave the creation , then He ( him ) did well ,
then He made of it the duality , the male and the feminine ? !
is He not capable of He enlivening the dead ?
came people for a while from the time when he was nothing mentionable ? !
Certainly , We created the man from mixed Nutfa to test him , then We made him hearing , seeing .
Certainly , WE guided him to the way right , either thanking or extremely kufr wom-@ operating .
Certainly , We prepared the Kafir chains , shackles , and heat heat .
Certainly , the gooddness drink of the wine mixed with camphor ,
from a source from which Allah &apos;s servants drink , they let them bubble vigorously .
they fulfill the vow and fear a day whose wickedness has spread .
and they feed food despite love for the poor , for the orphans and for the prisoners :
&quot; We only feed on you for Allah &apos;s will . We want neither wages nor thanksgiving from you ,
Certainly we fear a dark , ominous day from our Lord . &quot;
then ALLAH protected them from the wickedness this day and gave them rays and joy ,
and forgave them for practicing patiently Jannah and silk ,
based on loungers . They see neither the sun nor the moon .
and close to them are their shadows and their fruits have been made very readily available .
and they are served with bowls of silver and cups that are glasses ,
Silver <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it is given to them to drink wine mixed with ginger ,
from a source in it which is called Sal stab-@ sabil .
and they are served by eternal young servants , when you see them , you think they are scattered pearls .
and when you see there , you see well-being and great wealth .
they covered clothes from green Sundos and Istabraq , and they were decorated with silver bracelets and their Lord gave them pure drink to drink .
certainly , this is a reward for you . and your aspiration has been richly rewarded .
Certainly , We sent you down the Quran in successive sending down .
so be patient with the judgment of your Lord , and listen to no missing or extremely Kufr --@ operator of them .
and remember the name of your LORD in the morning , and before the sunset .
and from the night , so Sujud do for Him and praise Him for a long time at night !
Certainly , these love the present and behind them they ignore a difficult day .
We created them and reinforced their joints , and if WE wanted , WE would have exchanged them with their peers .
surely this is an admonition ; so he who wants strikes a way to his Lord .
and you do not want Allah except . Indeed , Allah is always omniscient , Wise .
He allows whom He wants to enter into His grace , and for the injustice of -@ passing He prepared painful punishment .

on the day the glory and angels are in turn , they do not speak except the one who Alcy Allows to prove and says right things .
this is the true day ; so whoever pleases takes a return to his Lord .

then surely they will be thrown into Jahannam .
then they are told , &quot; This is what you used to deny . &quot;
certainly , no ! Certainly , the register of goodness -@ obedience is in &apos; Illiyin ,
and what do you know what Illiyin is
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> / marked register <unk>
which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Certainly , the good -@ obedience are in well-being .
<unk> <unk> lying <unk> <unk> <unk> .
you <unk> in their faces <unk> <unk> <unk> .
they are given to drink by a pure aroma drink ,
whose aroma is made of musk . and in it the competing have to compete ,
and <unk> mixture is <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> drink .
Certainly , those who committed severe transgressions used to make fun of those who internalized the Iman .
and as they passed them , they winked at each other .
and when they returned to their families , they returned joyfully .
and when they saw them , they said , &quot; Surely these are wandering .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
So on this day those who internalized the Iman make fun of the Kafir .
they <unk> lying <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> :
&quot; was the Kafir rewarded what they used to do ? &quot;
when <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and all the ear of his LORD , and it is for him ,
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and throws out what is in her and refrains from it ,
and all her ear is her ear , and it is up to her ,

certainly , you are a strenuous one to your Lord with effort to which you will meet .
therefore , with regard to the one to whom his register is given with his rights ,
so <unk> is subject to <unk> settlement ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his family <unk>
and concerning the one to whom his register is given from behind his back ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> call <unk> destruction <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> heat <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his family <unk>

surely , surely , his Lord was looking upon him .
<unk> <unk> <unk> swear <unk> <unk>
and <unk> night and <unk> <unk> <unk> together ,
and <unk> the moon <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to another .
why do they not internalize Iman ? !
and when the Quran is presented to them , they do not perform a brew .
no , but those who operated Kufr deny ,
and ALLAH knows better about what they are aware of .
so give them the &quot; joyful news &quot; about a painful punishment ,
except those who internalized the Iman and pleased to God , for whom a non-ending reward is intended .

and they disapproved of them nothing but that they internalized Iman of ALLAH , the only worthy , the ome-worthy ,
to which the dominion of the heavens and the earth belongs .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Certainly , for those who expose the momin -@ men and mumin -@ women of Fitna , then do not regret , the punishment of Jahannam and the punoning of the burning is destined .
Certainly , for those who have internalized the Iman and done good pleasing to God , Jannat flowed by rivers are destined .
surely , the violence of the offence of your Lord is fierce .
Certainly , He is the one who lets us begin and return .
and HE is The Forgiving , The Extremely Loving ,

then there is neither power , nor standing , for him .

We will <unk> you <unk> , <unk> <unk> forget

so admonish when admonition is useful .

you did not see how your LORD did to &apos; Aad ,

as well as Thamud , those who carved out the rock in the valley ,
and with Pharaoh from the pyramids ,
those <unk> crossed <unk> <unk> <unk> cities <unk>

then your LORD poured upon them a mixture of punishment ?
surely <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
therefore with regard to man , when He examines him and gives him him dignity and benefit , he says , &quot; My Lord showed dignity to me . &quot;
and concerning this , when He tests him , and if his riq does little to him , he says , &quot; My LORD humbled me . &quot;
no ! but you give no dignity to the orphan ,
and you do not inspire the food of the needy ,
and you consume inheritance in complete consume ,

when the earth is crushed in crushing after crushing ,
and the instruction of your LORD , and the angels came up in ranks ,
and that day Jahannam is brought , that day man remembers , and how shall the memory benefit him ?
he says , &quot; I would only have presented something for my life ! &quot;
so on that day no one torments like His punishment ,
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> shackles .

it is the liberation of a nonfree ,

then he was of those who internalized the Iman and admonished each other for patience and admonished each other to mercy .

then ALLAH &apos;s messenger told them : &quot; ( let ) the camel female of ALLAH and ( avoids ) her potions . &quot;
then they accused him of falsehood , then they hurt his legs ( female camel ) , then their Lord destroyed them because of their transgression , then He made it even to them .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .

and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

and his wealth does not benefit him when he is founded .
<unk> , we are responsible for <unk> .
and surely we have both the last and the first .
so I warned you of a fire that blazes ,
into which no one but the least is thrown ,

neither your Lord left you , nor is He averse to you .
and the last is better for you than the first .
and surely your Lord will give you ( so much ) so that you are satisfied .
If He did not find you as an orphan , then did He grant you security ? !
and He found you mistaken , so He guided you .
and He found you poor , then He made you rich .
so with regard to the orphan , so do not suppress !

and they were not commanded except that they serve Allah - sincerely in Din towards Him as Hanif - to perform ritual prayer properly and pay the Zakate ; and this is the Din of straightforwardness .
