Summary <unk> <unk> AR <unk> <unk> <unk>
this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) , which explains how the Committee on Medicinal Products for Veterinary ( CVMP ) assessed the documents submitted in order to obtain recommendations on the application of the veterinary medicinal product .
this document cannot replace the personal conversation with the veterinarian .
If you need more information about your animal &apos;s health or treatment , please contact your veterinarian .
For further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CVMP , please refer to the scientific discussion ( which is also part of the EPAR ) .

Yarvitan contains the active ingredient mitratapid , which helps to reduce weight in dogs .
Yarvitan is a colorless to slightly yellow solution .
55 F -@ ml- or 120 Â -@ ml --@ bottles for dogs weighing up to 36 kg and a 210 bed-@ ml -@ bottle for dogs that weigh up to 48 kg .
<unk> <unk> <unk> arvitan <unk> <unk>
Yarvitan is used as help for weight loss in adult dogs that are overweight or obese ( obese ) .
it is used as part of a program , which also includes a restriction of the dog &apos;s food intake .
the drug is administered to the dog for 3 weeks , followed by a 2 week week break break during which the veterinarian adapts the dog &apos;s diet to its energy needs .
The dog then receives the drug for a further 3 weeks in addition to the adapted diet .
the required dose is calculated according to the weight of the dog , and the Yarvitan -@ solution is administered to the animal with the food .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> vitan <unk>
the medicinal ingredient in Yarvitan , mitratapid , acts in the intestine by blocking a protein ( the microsomal triglyceride -@ transfer protein ) .
this protein is usually involved in the resorption of fats from the food .
by blocking the protein , Yarvitan reduces the absorption of fats from the intestine .
due to its mode of action , Yarvitan also has a slight appetizing effect .
<unk> <unk> <unk> arvit<unk> <unk>
Yarvitan was studied in dogs in both laboratory and field studies .
two major field studies , one in Europe and one in the USA , were carried out on healthy dogs with a body weight , which was 20 % above the recommended weight .
about three quarters received Yarvitan , while the rest received the drug without the active ingredient ( control group ) .
the dogs received during the study 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .

Yarvitan reduced body weight in obese dogs compared to the control group , at the recommended dose and using the 3 -@ 2 gesund-@ 3 Feb-@ weekly treatment plan .
the weight-reducing effect was relatively moderate ( in the range of 6 fri-@ 7 % of body weight before treatment ) .
Treatment is a initial measure as part of a programme to reduce overweight and must be combined with nutritional changes , which must be maintained even after the end of treatment .

3 / 21 4.8 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
No interactions with other drugs have been taken into account in studies in which yarvitan was administered simultaneously with NSAIDs ( carprofen , meloxicam ) or ACE -@ inhibitors ( enalapril , benazepril ) .
Interactions with other types of medicinal products were not specifically investigated .
the absorption of fat-soluble drugs with simultaneous use with mitratapide was not investigated .
therefore , dogs that , in addition to this , receive other medicines should be closely monitored with regard to drug interactions .
4.9 Dosage and type of application For typing .
the veterinary medicinal product is to be administered once a day at a dosage of 0.63 mg mitratapid / kg body weight ( corresponding to 1 ml of the drug per 8 kg ) .
To ensure the correct dosage , the dog should be weighed on day 1 and on day 35 ( i.e. , at the beginning of each treatment period ) .
the veterinary medicinal product should be administered together with the feed .
use the dosing pipette supplied with the medicinal product for administration .
during the first 21 -@ day treatment , the animal &apos;s feed may remain unchanged .
then the dog should be fed according to its need for maintenance ( this is to be calculated by the veterinarian ) .
this can be achieved either with normal animal feed or with a dietary food ( with a reduced amount of calories ) .
in clinical trials , the treated animals increased rapidly after the end of treatment if the diet was not restricted .
in order to avoid this rapid weight gain ( rebound ) , the restrictive feeding after the maintenance needs must be continued after the end of treatment with the drug .
the therapy with Mitratrapid should be limited to treatment for a dog .
4.10 Overdose ( symptoms , emergency measures , antidotes ) , if necessary
after a 3- or 5 fac-@ fold overdose in dogs , the following symptoms were observed : soft or liquid stool , vomiting , salivation , anorexia , severe weight loss , emaciated appearance , dehydration and pale mucous membranes .
in case of accidental overdose , symptomatic therapy should be carried out .

Zactran is an injection solution for cattle containing the active ingredient gamithromycin ( 150 mg / ml ) .
<unk> <unk> <unk> Zactran <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> antibiotic <unk>
it is used to treat and prevent respiratory diseases ( Bovine Respiratory Disease , Germany ) caused by the bacteria Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni .
before the use of Zactran for the prevention of Germany , the occurrence of the disease in the herd should have been detected .
Zactran is administered as a one-off subcutaneous injection ( injected under the skin ) .
the dose to be applied is calculated based on the weight of the animal to be treated .
Animals weighing more than 250 kg must be administered the injection in more than one place .
<unk> <unk> <unk> actr<unk> <unk>
the active ingredient of zactran , gamithromycin , is an antibiotic from the group of macrolides .
it works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes , i.e. the parts of the cells in which proteins are produced , and thus inhibits the growth of the bacteria .
<unk> <unk> Zactran <unk>
suitable studies have been carried out to prove the efficacy of Zactran in cattle .
the main clinical studies were carried out on farms in a number of countries in Europe as well as outside the EU .
the effect of Zactran on the treatment of FRG was investigated compared to another EU macrolide fil-@ antibiotic ( Tulathromycin ) on already diseased cattle .
the effect of Zactran on the prevention of Germany was investigated compared to a placebo ( sham drug ) on cattle in the same farm with

what are the benefits of Zactran in these studies ?
it has been proven that Zactran was effective in the treatment and prevention of Germany caused by Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni .
for the treatment of FRG , Zactran has proved to be as effective as Tulathromycin .

After injecting Zactran , swelling at the injection site occurs up to 45 % of the animals .
the animals may also show signs of mild pain for a day .
Swelling generally recresses within 3 to 14 days , but can remain in some animals up to 35 days after treatment .
what precautions must be taken by persons who administer the medicinal product or come into contact with the animal ?
Persons with known hypersensitivity ( allergy ) to similar antibiotics ( from the group of macrolides ) should avoid contact with Zactran .
Zactran can cause eye or skin irritation .
therefore contact with skin or eyes should be avoided .
if Zactran comes into direct contact with the eyes , if they should be rinsed out immediately with clear water .
with direct skin contact , the affected area should also be washed off immediately with clear water .
in the case of accidental self-injection , a doctor should be consulted immediately and shown the package leaflet or label .
how long must be waited until the laughter of the beast and the consumption of the meat by man ( waiting time ) ?
the animals may only be slaughtered 64 days after the last administration of Zactran .
how long must be maintained until the milk of the animal can be used for human consumption ?
Since the safety of Zactran in breeding animals has not been investigated , the drug must not be used in lactating cows or heifers whose milk is intended for human consumption .
it must also not be used for pregnant cows or heifers whose milk is intended for human consumption in the last two months before the date of birth .
Why <unk> <unk> actr<unk> <unk> <unk>
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Zactran in the therapeutic and preventive treatment of respiratory diseases in beef ( Federal Republic of Germany ) caused by Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni ( if the occurrence of the disease was detected in the herd ) outweigh over the risks , and recommended granting authorisation for the placing on the market of Zactran .

Macrolide antibiotics have both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects , as they interrupt bacterial protein synthesis by bying to the ribosomal 50S -@ subunit and thus preventing prolongation of the peptide chain .
in in -@ vitro , -@ data prove that gamithromycin has a bactericidal effect .
these pathogenic germs are most often involved in the Federal Republic of Germany .
the following MHK and MBK , --@ data come from representative samples of field disolates within various geographical regions of the EU .

Zubrin is a lyophilisate for taking , i.e. a kind of tablet that quickly disintegrates after contact with moisture , for example when placed on the dog &apos;s tongue .
Zubrin contains the effective ingredient tepoxalin .
<unk> <unk> Zubrin used <unk>
Zubrin is used in dogs against inflammation and to relieve pain in acute and chronic diseases of the musculoskeletal system .
Zubrin is given to the dog once a day about 1 -@ 2 hours after feeding until the animal is better again .
However , since side effects may occur , any treatment should be carried out for more than 1 - 2 weeks under regular veterinary control .
<unk> <unk> <unk> ubrin <unk> <unk>
Zubrin contains tepoxaline , which belongs to the drug class of the so-called non-steroidal antiphlogistics ( NSAID ) .
Zubrin works by blocking the enzymes Cyclooxygenase Engn-@ 1 and Cyclooxygenase Engn-@ 2 .
when blocking enzymes , less prostaglandin is formed .
since the prostaglandins are substances that cause inflammation , tepoxalin reduces the inflammation and swelling of muscles or joints and the associated pain .

Zubrin was investigated in laboratory animals and diseased dogs in various veterinary practices / clinics in the USA and a number of countries in Europe ( &quot; clinical trials &quot; ) .
in these clinical studies , the animal owners administered their dogs Zubrin once a day at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight of the dog with or without food .
the best results were achieved when Zubrin was administered 1 - 2 hours after feeding .
However , since side effects may occur , any treatment should be carried out for more than 1 - 2 weeks under regular veterinary control .
Zubrin was just as effective as other medications of the same class and led to a significant improvement in dogs with muscle or joint complaints .
<unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> Zubrin ?
the side effects of Zubrin are the ones that can also be observed in other NSAIDs , such as
Vomiting , soft feces or diarrhea , blood in the feces , decreased appetite and matlness .
Vomiting or diarrhea was observed in ten dogs .
occasionally it can lead to hair loss or skin redness .
if such adverse effects can be observed in your dog , you should not administer Zubrin further .
In addition , if your dog receives further medications , you should inform the veterinarian before the start of treatment with Zubrin , as some drugs can affect each other in their efficacy .
what precautions must be taken by persons who administer the medicinal product or come into contact with the animal ?
Zubrin has a special dosage form ( lyophilisate ) , which quickly dissolves in contact with moisture and can become slippery or sticky when it is held in hand .
Therefore , you should make sure that you administer the medication with dry hands .
FALLS the lyophilisate dissolves prematurely in your hand , wash your hands thoroughly .
Zubrin should be put the dog directly in the mouth , and you should try to keep the dog &apos;s catch closed for a moment .
It <unk> not be used in <unk> .
Whenever someone still accidentally takes some tablets , a doctor should be consulted immediately .
<unk> <unk> <unk> ubrin <unk> <unk>
the Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Zubrin in the treatment of inflammation or pain in muscles or joints in dogs outweigh the risks and recommended that authorisation be granted for placing Zubrin on the market .

After administration of a therapeutic dose of 10 mg / kg , the Cmax of tepoxalin in fed dogs was 1.08 ± 0.37 µg / ml ( low-fat feed ) and 1.19 ± 0.29 µg / ml ( high-fat feed ) .
the resorption of tepoxalin is favoured by administration to fed dogs .
tepoxalin is converted into its acid metabolites .
the acid metabolite is a highly effective cyclooxygenase fil-@ inhibitor and prolongs the effectiveness of the mother substance .
in the dog , the plasma concentrations of the acid metabolite are higher than those of the mother substance .
