3.1 Determination of the normal value for all executing manufacturers without MWB
<unk> <unk> Compar<unk> <unk>
Pursuant to Article 2 ( 7 ) of the General Regulation , the normal value in the case of imports from countries from countries without a market economy and , if companies cannot be granted , must be determined from countries specified in Article 2 ( 7 ) ( b ) of the General Ordinance on the basis of the price or the calculated value in a comparative country .
( 36 ) In the announcement of the opening of the procedure , the Commission proposed Turkey as an appropriate comparative country to determine the normal value for the People &apos;s Republic of China and invited the interested parties to comment on this respect .
( 37 ) Some interested parties objected to this proposal .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Turkey were :
- lack of competition in the Turkish domestic market ( there are only three manufacturers in Turkey ) ;
- production in Turkey represents 1.3 % of Chinese production ;
- the cost structure of Chinese manufacturers differs from that of Turkish manufacturers , in particular in terms of labour and raw material costs ;
- the economic and cultural relations of the People &apos;s Republic of China and those of Turkey with the EU are different because Turkey is closer to Europe , has been benefiting from a customs union with the EU since 1995 and bringing its legislation to the EU nor--@ standards in the light of Turkey &apos;s negotiations &apos;s accession to the EU ;
- the Turkish currency lost value ; some Turkish manufacturers are associated with applicants ;
- <unk> quality of <unk> <unk> <unk> low .
( 38 ) The interested parties proposed India or Russia as suitable comparative countries .
( 39 ) The Commission sought to operate from other potential comparative countries such as Russia , India , Japan , South Korea , the United States , Serbia and Montenegro and South Africa .
of the 38 companies around the world she contacted , only two companies in the US agreed to participate .
( 40 ) The analysis of the available information revealed that there is competition on the US -@ American market for the affected goods with at least three manufacturers , around 30 suppliers , more than 15 introducers and around 300 users .
According to the investigation results , as mentioned under recital 14 , the goods concerned and the Magnesia stones manufactured in the Federal Republic of China or the USA and each sold on the domestic markets of the same kind were similar to the same .
Furthermore , the study revealed that more than 50 % of the raw materials used by one of the US -@ American manufacturers were introduced from the People &apos;s Republic of China and that the manufacturing processes in the two countries did not differ significantly .
( 41 ) It shall provisionally conclude that the United States of America was the most appropriate and justifiable comparative country within the meaning of Article 2 ( 7 ) of the General Regulation .
b <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> value
( 42 ) In accordance with Article 2 ( 7 ) ( a ) of the General Ordinance , the normal value for those implementing manufacturers manufacturers who were not granted MWB was determined on the basis of the verified information of the manufacturer in the comparative country .
According to the investigation results , sales of the US C--@ American manufacturers were transactions in normal trade , the normal value for the product types comparable to the types of goods exported from the People &apos;s Republic of China to the Community was determined on the prices of prices paid or paid on the US --@ American domestic market .
( 43 ) The normal value was the weighed average domestic selling price , which the cooperating US --@ American manufacturers charged to independent customers for types of goods with comparable MgO -@ salary .
if necessary , corrections were made for the different treatments of the different types of goods .
3.2 Determination of the normal value for the executing manufacturers to whom an MWB was granted
( 44 ) It should be recalled that the dumping range for the companies granted to an MWB was determined on the basis of their information on the domestic sales and the production costs for the goods concerned .
this data has been audited by the companies concerned .
( 45 ) In order to determine the normal value , the Commission first examined for each cooperating executive manufacturer whether the entire domestic sales of the goods concerned were representative compared to the entire export sales to the Community .
In accordance with Article 2 ( 2 ) of the General Ordinance , domestic sales were considered representative if the total amount of these sales of each executive manufacturer corresponded to at least 5 % of the total amount of the manufacturer &apos;s export sales to the Community .
( 46 ) On this basis it was found that the domestic sales of the affected goods were representative of an executive manufacturer in the UZ .
the domestic sales of the affected goods of the other executing manufacturer in the UZ were not representative .
( 47 ) For the executive manufacturer with representative domestic sales , the Commission then determined the types of goods sold on the domestic market , which were identical or directly comparable to the types sold for export to the Community .
( 48 ) For each type sold on the domestic market , which , according to the investigation results , was directly comparable to a type sold for export to the Community , it was examined whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative within the meaning of Article 2 ( 2 ) of the General Ordinance .
Domestic sales of a particular type of goods were considered sufficiently representative if the total volume of domestic sales of this type in the UZ corresponded to 5 % or more of the total volume of export sales of the comparable type of goods to the Community .
( 49 ) This analysis showed that the executive manufacturer with total representative sales did not sell all domestic product types in representative quantities .
( 50 ) The Commission then examined whether the domestic sales of the individual types of goods sold in representative quantities on the domestic market could be regarded as transactions in normal trade ; for each purpose , the share of profitable sales to independent customers was determined .
( 51 ) Domestic sales were considered profitable if the unit price of the respective type of goods corresponded at least to the production costs .
therefore , the production costs were determined for each product type sold in the UZ on the domestic market .
( 52 ) As mentioned under recitals 50 and 51 , the share of profitable sales of the product type in question to independent customers on the domestic market was determined .
in cases where the sales quantity of a type sold at a net selling price in the amount of the mathematically determined production costs or above , 80 % or more corresponded to the total sales quantity of that type and in which the weighed average price of the type in question was at least the production costs , the normal value was based on the actual domestic price that was determined as the weighed average of the prices of all domestic sales made in the UZ , regardless of whether these sales were profitable or not .
in cases where the volume of profitable sales of a type made for less than 80 % of the total sales volume of the type in question or where the weighed average price of the type in question was below production costs , the normal was based on the actual domestic price , determined as a weighed average only of profitable sales , provided that the volume of these sales made for 10 % or more of the total sales volume of the type in question .
( 53 ) If the profitable sales of a type were less than 10 % of the total sales volume , the view was held that the sales volumes of this type were not sufficient to be able to use the domestic price as an appropriate basis for determining the normal value .
( 54 ) The above analysis showed that certain types of goods were sold in normal trade .
( 55 ) For all types of goods that were either not in representative quantities or - due to the invoiced prices - not sold in normal trade ( cf . Recitations 52 and 53 ) , the domestic prices of the executive manufacturer in question could not be used to determine the normal value , so that another method had to be used .
( 56 ) In cases where the domestic prices of a certain type sold by an executive manufacturer could not be used , the normal value had to be calculated on the basis of the costs of the manufacturer in question .
the normal value was calculated mathematically in accordance with Article 2 ( 3 ) of the General Ordinance by adding an appropriate amount for the distribution , administrative and overhead costs ( hereinafter called &quot; VVG -@ costs &quot; to the production costs of the types carried out ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; VVG -@ costs &quot; ) .
To this end , the Commission examined whether the VVG -@ costs and the profits recorded by the company were reliable .
( 57 ) The VVG -@ costs actually recorded were considered to be reliable if the total volume of the domestic sales of the company in question could be considered representative compared to the volume of export sales to the Community .
the domestic profit margin was determined on the basis of domestic sales of the types sold in normal trade .
this was done on the basis of the method set out under recitals 45 , 48 , 52 and 53 .
for a company , the actually recorded VVG in --@ costs and profits could be used because it met the aforementioned criteria .
( 58 ) For the other company whose domestic sales were not representative , the normal value was determined in accordance with Article 2 ( 6 ) ( c ) of the General Ordinance .
According to the investigation results , the cost structure of the other company with MWB and representative domestic sales for only some types of goods showed such deviations that it was not a reasonable basis for determining the normal value .
However , the costs of the company , whose domestic sales were not representative , were reliable according to the investigation results , so that the normal value was determined on the basis of the company &apos;s data that corresponded to those of the other exporters / manufacturers of the same goods in that country of origin .
<unk> export <unk>
( 59 ) All export sales to the community of exectors with MWB or IT were handled either through related importers in the community , associated importers outside the community or through companies that were not associated with the executive manufacturers but worked closely with them or even had the exclusive distribution right .
in cases where exports were sold through affiliated companies , export prices prices were calculated in accordance with Article 2 ( 9 ) of the General Regulation .
in all cases where the exports of the goods concerned went to independent customers in the Community , the export price was calculated in accordance with Article 2 ( 8 ) of the General Regulation on the basis of the export prices actually paid or to be paid .
( 60 ) In accordance with Article 2 ( 9 ) of the General Regulation , corrections have been made for all costs incurred by the importer between import and resale , including the VVG --@ costs and an appropriate profit margin .
in this case , the profit margin actually recorded by the cooperating independent introducporters was considered a justifiable basis .

( 61 ) The normal value and export prices were compared at the level ex works and at the same trading level .
in the interest of a fair settlement , corrections for differences were made on request pursuant to Article 2 ( 10 ) of the General Regulation , which demonstrably influenced the prices and comparability of the prices .
( 62 ) These corrections concerned differences in transport , insurance , provision , loading and ancillary costs , borrowing costs , commissions , import duties and customer service costs ( guarantee ) .

6.1 Cooperating executive manufacturers who have been granted an MWB / IB
( 63 ) In the case of the two companies to which a MC was granted , pursuant to Article 2 ( 11 ) of the General Ordinance , the weighed average normal value of the individual types of the goods exported to the Community was compared with the weighed average export price of the corresponding type .
64 . In the case of the four companies to which an IB was granted , the weighed average normal value of the individual types of goods exported to the Community was compared with the weighed average export price of the corresponding type under Article 2 ( 11 ) of the General Regulation determined for the comparative country .
( 65 ) The provisional weighed average dumping ranges , expressed as a percentage of cif --@ prices free Community limit , unpaid uted , reach the following values :

( 66 ) To calculate the dumping range for all other exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China , the Commission initially determined the scope of cooperation .
To this end , it compared the total imports of the goods concerned originating in the Federal People &apos;s Republic of China on the basis of the Eurostat -@ statistics according to the method set out under Recital 81 , to the responses of the cooperating exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China .

( 67 ) In view of the low cooperation , the dumping range for all other exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China was set in the amount of the highest dumping range determined for the cooperating manufacturers , namely 99.9 % of the cif --@ price free Community fronary ary was unpaid .
However , according to the results , the nationwide dumping range was higher than the residual damage margin .

( 68 ) In this study , it was found that Magnesia -@ Stones were made by :
- two applicant Community manufacturers and two other manufacturers who worked fully with the Commission during the investigation ( RHI , LWB , Refractarios Burceña S.L. and Ceramica del Nalon S.A. ) ;
- a manufacturer who answered the questionnaire in detail , but spoke out against the procedure ( refracing technique ) ;
- seven other manufacturers and assopiate relels ( Italian Association of Reffractory -@ Industry , which represents a production of 64000 tonnes ) , which supported the Community industry , but did not answer the questionnaire in detail .
another manufacturer sent a letter , but did not express itself approvingly or objection .

2.1 Manufacturers or manufacturers associated with the People &apos;s Republic of China who import the affected goods from the Republic of China
( 69 ) The investigation revealed that two of the cooperating manufacturers in the community , namely RHI and Refratechnik , also introduced the affected goods from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
For this reason , it has been examined whether these companies should be excluded from the Community Community sector in accordance with Article 4 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the General Regulation .
<unk> 1.1 <unk> <unk> <unk>
( 70 ) RHI produces in the Community , but also introduces the goods concerned by an affiliated Joint -@ Venture fil-@ Company in the People &apos;s Republic &apos;s Republic of China , RHI Liaoning .
It was found that in the UZ , the majority of the Community sales of RHI were produced in the Community and that only a small proportion came from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
this share is low , because the Chinese production of RHI is primarily destined for the fast-growing Asian market .
RHI is also the largest manufacturer in the Community , and its headquarters , the R &amp; amp ; D -@ Centre and the largest production facilities are located in the Community .
For this reason , it was found that RHI &apos;s core business with the goods concerned is located in the Community .
( 71 ) Subsequently , it was examined the impact of the sale of the imported goods on the total sales of the company in the Community .
the investigation found that RHI did not have any significant profitability benefits from the resale of imports .
this resulted in a comparison of the profitability of cooperating Community manufacturers .
( 72 ) Given the low share of imports and the fact that these imports had no significant positive impact on the profitability of Community sales as a whole , this company was not immune from the negative effects of damaging dumping .
For this reason , the view is held that it would not be justified to exclude RHI from the Community sector .
<unk> <unk> Ref<unk> <unk>
( 73 ) Refratechnik also produces the affected goods in the community and introduces them from manufacturers in the Federal Republic of China .
the investigation found that almost half of the company &apos;s joint sales in the UZ UZ in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
It has also been noted that the expansion of business activities was essentially made possible by an increase in imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
For this reason , the view was held that the core business of Refratechnik is located not only in the community , but also in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
( 74 ) It then examined how the sales introduced affected the Company &apos;s total sales in the Community .
the investigation revealed that in contrast to RHI , Refratechnik had a significant benefit from the resale of imports .
( 75 ) In view of the high proportion of imports in the total amount of sales in the Community and the fact that the core business appears to be gradually transferred to the People &apos;s Republic of China and that Refratechnik clearly had a benefit from dumped imports , it was held that Refratechnik should be excluded from the Community industry in accordance with Article 4 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the General Regulation and is to be regarded as &quot; other market participants &quot; .
<unk> Community <unk>
( 76 ) Production of the four Community manufacturers who fully participated in the investigation , including RHI and without refrate technology , amounted to 233732 tonnes during the period under investigation , representing a share of 53 % of the total Community production , which these companies form the industry of the Community within the meaning of Article 4 ( 1 ) ( 5 ) ( 4 ) of the General Regulation .
( 77 ) The study revealed no self-consumption of the affected goods for the Magnesia -@ Steine producing industry .
some steel companies , on the other hand , produced Magnesia -@ stones for self-consumption .
However , this amount was low compared to the production volumes of the refractory --@ industry in the community .
since this production is intended for self-consumption in the steel industry and none of the companies in the steel industry have worked as a manufacturer of Magnesia --@ Steinen ( although many of them received questionnaires ) , this part of the production seems to have no significant impact on the economy of the Community .
( 78 ) As the Community industry consisted of four companies and two of these companies accounted for around 2 % of the production volume , the following information for the Community industry was indexed for confidentiality reasons .
3 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
( 79 ) Consumption was determined on the basis of estimates by the industry transmitted by the Community industry according to the usual practice .
the calculation of this data was carried out on the basis of steel production ( source : relevant reports from the International Iron and Steel Institute - IISI ) , divided by the average amount of the goods concerned , which is known for the production of a ton of steel .
( 80 ) The import quantities were determined on the basis of the Eurostat reli-@ data for the relevant KN fil-@ codes ( 68159100 , 68159910 , 68151010 , 68159990 , 69021000 and 69039020 ) .
of the quantities determined , deductions were carried out for those goods which were clearly not the goods concerned , were given their price .
The net quantities resulting after deduction ( together 73291 tonnes for all countries and 59831 tonnes for the People &apos;s Republic of China ) were compared with the import volumes specified by the cooperating manufacturers in the People &apos;s Republic of China ( around 42000 tonnes ) .
Given that some 13500 tonnes were imported from countries other than than the People of the Republic of China , ii , according to the importers and users in the Community , the goods concerned were also introduced by non-cooperating instructors in the People &apos;s Republic of China , and iii many other manufacturers received questionnaires in the People &apos;s Republic of China , but did not cooperate , the view was held that the Eurostat -@ statistics record the import volumes correctly .
In addition , China Metallurgical News ( 4 January 2004 ) reported that 80,000 tonnes were exported to Europe in 2003 , which ating that the aforementioned Eurostat -@ number is by no means too high for the UZ ( 598too high .
( 81 ) Sales of the Community Community sector on the Community market were determined on the basis of the verified responses of the five cooperating Community manufacturers ( including refrate technology ) to the questionnaire .
the remaining quantities ( i.e. consumption less imports minus sales of the Community industry ) were considered to be sales of the non-cooperating Community manufacturers .
( 82 ) The consumption determined in this way , the development of which is shown in the following table , shows that the demand for the goods concerned in the Community was practically constant during the reference period .

( 84 ) While the consumption of Magnesia -@ stones remained constant during the reference period , imports from the country concerned increased by around 150 % during the same period .

prices were compared after deduction of all discounts and volume discounts .
the prices of the Community industry were put to the factory on the stage , and import prices were based on the cif --@ free Community prices .
( 87 ) The comparison showed that the imports of the goods concerned in the UZ were sold in the Community at prices that were 16.6 % below the prices of the Community sector ( expressed as a percentage of the prices of the Community sector ) .
In view of this undercut range and the described development of the prices of the Community Community sector , it is clear that prices have already been pushed considerably .

( 88 ) In accordance with Article 3 ( 5 ) of the General Regulation , the examination of the impact of dumped imports on the Community sector included an assessment of all economic factors and indices affecting the situation of the Community industry from 2001 ( base year ) to the UZ .
( 89 ) The following information on the Community industry is the aggregate data of the four cooperating Community manufacturers .
5.1 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> capacity
( 90 ) Production , production capacity and capacity utilization developed as follows :

( 91 ) As the above table shows , production fell by 9 % during the reference period .
to save costs , the production capacity was reduced by 16 % , which led to an increase in capacity utilization of 8 % .

Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 109 _ BAR _ 105 _ BAR _ 108 _ BAR _
( 93 ) The inventories increased by 8 % in the reference compartment .
the Community industry usually produces the affected goods on order .
the level of the inventories was therefore not found to be particularly meaningful for assessing the situation of the Community industry .
5.3 Sales , market share , growth and average unit prices in the Community
( 94 ) The table below shows sales of the Community industry to independent Community buyers .
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Sales ( in tons ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 97 _ BAR _ 99 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _

average selling price ( EUR / ton ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _
( 95 ) The sales volumes and the market share of the Community industry were constant during the reference period .
However , given the advpush of dumped imports into the Community market , this was only achieved by reducing average selling prices by 11 % .
( 96 ) However , the 11 % decline in average prices does not reflect the decline in prices in key market segments .
the affected goods are mainly used in the steel industry to wall three types of vessels ( pans , converters and electric arc furnaces ) .
Initially , the imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China consisted above all of ladle stones in the lower market segment .
during the reference period , however , there was a trend towards the penetration of the higher segments of the converters and electric arc furnaces .
Converters and electric arc furnaces must achieve a maximum service life , which means that more expensive stones of high quality must be used to increase the number of furnace journeys before renewal of the lining .
an analysis of the sales structure during the reference period showed that the Community industry was geared towards lower volumes for the high-quality market segments to oppose the pressure of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
this development shows that the average prices of some product types fell by more than 11 % .
for example , the average price of the largest product group ( stones with 9 % residual carbon and melting magnesia ) fell by 19 % during the reference period .
( 97 ) Given the increase in imports , the Community industry did not grow despite a reduction in its average prices .
Rather , he was forced to reduce production capacity and jobs .

( 98 ) The profitability shown in the table below was calculated as a return on sales on the Community market .

Profitability of Community sales _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 76 _ BAR _ 26 _ BAR _ 45 _ BAR _
( 99 ) Profitability declined significantly between 2001 and 2003 as a result of price reductions , , which coincided with the increase in dumped imports from the PRRepublic of China .
in the UZ , profitability increased slightly again , which was primarily due to a cost reduction .
Although the Community &apos;s industry in the UZ made profits , the profit margin was significantly lower than in this type of industry would be normally expected in the absence of dumped imports .
As the table shows , the profitability in 2001 , when the market share of dumped imports was relatively low , was much higher as expected .
5.5 Return on investment ( RoI ) , cash flow , investments and capital opportunities
( 100 ) The table below provides an overview of the development of return on investment , cash flow and investments .
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _

Investment _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 75 _ BAR _ 131 _ BAR _ 134 _ BAR _
( 101 ) The table shows that the return on investment has largely developed in parallel to the return on sales ( see above ) .
Cash flow follows roughly the same trend , that is , it is declining from 2001 to 2003 and is recovering slightly in the UZ .
the decline in return on investment and cash flow reflects the fact that average selling prices fell faster than the average cost of goods sold .
( 102 ) The Community &amp; apos ; s industry has increased its investment .
they served above all the renewal of existing plants and machines , less the construction of new production facilities .
( 103 ) However , the possibilities of the Community industry to raise capital from credit institutions or parent companies were not seriously affected during the reference period because companies belong to larger corporations .
the capital raising opportunities are therefore primarily dependent on the strength of the Group and not necessarily on the realities in the business concerned .
this factor should therefore be irrelevant to this investigation .

( 104 ) As can be seen from the table , the Community economic sector reduced the number of its employees from 2001 to the UZ .
the increase between 2003 and the UZ can be explained by an increase in production .

( 105 ) Wages declined significantly in 2002 , but then remained constant until the UZ .
The reason for this was a restructuring programme that year , as above-mentioned development of production and employment shows .

Moreover , the impact of the actual dumping range cannot be considered immrelevant given the volume and prices of dumped imports .
5.8 Impact of previous dumping or subsidy practices
( 107 ) The Community industry has not recovered from the effects of previous dumping or subsidy practices , as no investigations have yet been carried out in this respect .
5.<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
( 108 ) While sales volumes and market share in the Community remained relatively constant , the Community industry was confronted with an average prices of 11 % during the reference period , although it changed its product -@ Mix in favour of higher-value product types .
Despite the cost savings , the profit margin decreased noticeably , so that profits in the UZ were 55 % below the 2001 level , so the profit margin was well below the level expected without dumped imports .
( 109 ) The deterioration in the situation of the Community industry in the reference period is also reflected in the reduction in production and production capacity , the decline in wages , employment , return on investment and cash flow , as well as a lack of growth despite 11 % reduction in average prices .
( 110 ) These negative developments fell into a time of relatively constant productivity , increasing investments and better capacity utilization .
the development of inventories and capital opportunities was considered not meaningful for the reasons set out above .
( 111 ) Taking into account all these indicators , it is provisionally concluded that the Community sector of the economy in the UZ was caused a significant damage within the meaning of Article 3 of the General Regulation .

( 112 ) It was also examined whether there was a causal link between dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China and damage to the Community industry .
other known factors than the dumped imports , which may have damaged the Community industry at the same time were examined to ensure that any damage caused by these other factors was not attributed to the dumped imports .
2 . Impact of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China
( 113 ) As was already shown above , the volume of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China increased by around 150 % and their market share by 118 % during the reference period .
As set out in recital 85 , the prices of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China also fell by 22 % , and a significant price undercut was noted ( see recital 86 ) .
In response to imports , the Community industry maintained its sales volume ( in order not to endanger economies of scale ) , but had to significantly reduce its prices .
Among other things , this price reduction led to a 55 % decline in profitability .
this means that profitability is significantly lower than this type of industry is expected ; this level is no longer sustainable .
3 <unk> Impact <unk> imports <unk> third <unk>
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Imports from other countries other than the People &apos;s Republic of China _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 90 _ BAR _ 140 _ BAR _ 141 _ BAR _
( 114 ) It is highly unlikely that imports originating in third countries such as the Republic of Korea and Brazil may have contributed to the damage to the Community industry .
the market share of imports from countries other than the People &apos;s Republic of China was only around 3 % in the UZ .
Furthermore , the average prices of imports from the Republic of Korea and Brazil ( i.e. the third countries in addition to the People &apos;s Republic of China , from which the largest quantities were imported ) were 25 % or 47 % higher than the prices of imports originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
Given the market share and the relatively high prices of imports from other third countries , it can be concluded that these imports , if at all , have made a minimal contribution to the damage to the Community industry .
4 . Impact of competition between Community manufacturers and overcapacity
( 115 ) Some interested parties claimed that the Community industry had been forced to reduce its prices in competition to a harmful level due to the overcapacity of the refractory -@ industry .
However , the capacity utilization determined in the investigation for the reference period , the development of which is listed in indexed form under Recital 90 , does not confirm this claim .
Rather , it was comparable to the capacity utilization of the steel industry and other similar industries .
even though capacity was clearly dismantled and prices fell , this was primarily a response to the increase in dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
the Commission also points out that a comprehensive restructuring of the Community refractory &apos;s fil-@ @ industry took place as early as the late 1990s .
5 <unk> Impact <unk> developments <unk> <unk> steel industry
( 116 ) It was claimed that the technical progress , which enables the production of stones with a longer life as well as efficient steel production , had caused damage to the Community industry .
During the investigation , several steel producers stated that their consumption of Magnesia -@ stones per tonne of produced steel had fallen as a result of technical progress .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Steel production of EU . -@ 25 ( kilotonnes ) _ BAR _ 180531 _ BAR _ 180758 _ BAR _ 183441 _ BAR _ 185197 _ BAR _

Stone consumption in the steel industry ( tons per kilotonne ) _ BAR _ 2,21 _ BAR _ 2,20 _ BAR _ 2,19 _ BAR _ 2,16 _ BAR _
this table shows that Magnesia , -@ stones have only a stake of about 2 % in steel production .
a decline in this share would therefore not explain the decline in selling prices and profitability described in the section on damage .
For this reason , the view is held that the higher technical quality of the stones cannot have been no major cause of the damage to the Community industry .
( 117 ) The investigation revealed that some steel generators continue to produce a certain proportion of Magnesia nat-@ stones themselves .
However , there are no indications that this practice would have been extended over time .
Furthermore , since no steel company as a manufacturer of Magnesia -@ Steinen contributed to the investigation , it can be assumed that this production sector had no effect on the economic situation of the Community industry .
6 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> fluctuations
( 118 ) Another factor allegedly responsible for the damage was the change in the exchange rate of the dollar and euro .
this could be relevant , as the Chinese renminbi was coupled to the dollar for many years ; allegedly the fluctuations in the exchange rate of the dollar and euro have made exports to the community more attractive to Chinese manufacturers .
( 119 ) However , the price loss of the dollar against the euro did not always coincide with the increase in imports .
the decline in the dollar price began in June 2002 , while imports increased significantly as early as 2001 .
In addition , the freight costs from the People &apos;s Republic of China to the Community increased considerably during the reference period .
if imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China had only increased because market conditions had improved as a result of the exchange rate change , a decline or at least a stabilisation of imports had been expected as soon as the increase in freight costs compensated for the exchange rate change .
although such compensation actually occurred ( in the last 15 months of the subscription period , freight costs have increased by around 25 % according to P &amp; O Nedlloyd ) , imports continued to increase .
( 120 ) For this reason , it is provisionally concluded that the effects of the exchange rate changes may hardly have contributed to damage to the Community industry .
7 . Effects of Community imports into the Community
( 121 ) Some interested parties claimed that the damage was self-caused because the Community industry introduced the goods concerned from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
As set out above , imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China , in the case of RHI , which is part of the Community industry , account for 5 % of its total sales on the Community market .
The share and difference in the prices of these imports compared to Community sales are relatively small and cannot have had a major impact on the market .
8 <unk> Eff<unk> <unk> Community <unk> <unk>
( 122 ) In the UZ , the Community industry spent around 27 % of its production from the Community .
the export volume decreased only slightly during this period .
However , the profitability of these exports was higher than that of Community sales , so that it cannot be claimed that they have contributed to the damage to the Community economy .
9 <unk> Conclu<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
( 123 ) As already set out , the damage in this case was primarily in the form of price pressure , which caused a decline in profitability .
Taking into account the fact that the prices of the rapidly increasing imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China were well below those of the Community industry , there is nothing to suggest that the above-mentioned factors could have been a major cause of the significant damage to the Community industry .
No other factors were found in the investigation that could have caused significant damage .
( 124 ) On the basis of this analysis of the impact of all known factors on the situation of the Community sector of the economy , it is provisionally concluded that there is a causal link between the dumped imports from the Federal Republic of China and the significant damage to the Community industry .
E. <unk> MM<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> consider<unk>
( 125 ) It was examined whether there were compelling reasons for the conclusion that the introduction of anti-dumping tariffs on imports from the country concerned would run counter to Community interest .
the Commission sent questionnaires to importers , industrial users and suppliers .
One of 14 users , five suppliers and three independent introducers answered .
( 126 ) The following conclusions were drawn on the basis of the information received by the cooperating parties .
<unk> <unk> Inter<unk> <unk> Community <unk>
( 127 ) As is well known , the Community industry is a member of four manufacturers who employ around 800 people in the production and sale of the goods concerned .
It should also be recalled that the economic indicators examined above for the Community economic sector showed a deterioration in the business results during the reference period .
Despite the slight improvement in the UZ , the Community ’ s industry was unable to achieve a satisfactory financial situation due to the dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
( 128 ) It is clear that , in the event of a waiver of measures , more and more production facilities in the Community will be closed and the steel companies will be much more dependent on the Chinese goods .
There are currently only a few production facilities worldwide , and the majority of the raw materials ( especially magnesium oxide ) are located in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
For this reason , there are no sources of supply in other third countries .
As a result , the introduction of anti-dumping measures would obviously benefit the Community &amp; apos ; s industry .
( 129 ) For these reasons , it is temporarily concluded that the introduction of anti-dumping measures is in the interests of the Community industry .
3 <unk> Independent <unk> <unk> <unk>
( 130 ) Four companies answered the questionnaire for independent importers , although only two of them imported the goods in the UZ .
the cooperating importers opposed the introduction of measures and claimed that there were only a few large manufacturers of refractory products in the Community and imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China stimulated competition in the Community market .
If measures should be introduced and prices rise , Chinese companies may reduce their sales in the Community , and the importers would incur losses due to reduced trade and lower profitability .
( 131 ) An importer claimed that he may have to close his business with eight employees , since the goods concerned had a significant share of his business .
However , the aim of the anti-dumping measures is neither to prevent the import of the goods concerned , nor to make it difficult for the activities of the importers in the Community .
As the proposed measures affect only a relatively small part of the total cost of the Community steel industry and have business relations between Chinese Chinese executives and Community users based on specific technical requirements , it is most likely that the importers &apos; traditional business will continue even if anti-dumping measures are introduced compared to dumped imports .
( 132 ) In addition , it was found that introducing measures would have no significant consequences for the other importer , as the goods concerned have only a share of less than 1 % of the company turnover .
4 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
( 133 ) The suppliers who worked on the investigation supported the procedure .
two companies supplying the branch of the Community with the main raw material for Magnesia -Stones ( de-fided magnesite ) , claimed that they would have to cease the supply of the fire Party -industry a few years ago , as first raw materials from the Federal Republic of China and later also Magnesia stones from the Republic of China came on the market .
<unk> <unk> User <unk>
<unk> <unk> reliminary <unk> <unk> <unk>
( 134 ) 14 User companies , i.e. steel producers , answered the questionnaire , and another manufacturer as well as the Steel Trade Association submitted opinions .
another user supported the request of the Community industry , but all other steel companies opposed the introduction of anti-dumping measures .
Overall , user companies accounted for around 38 % of the Community consumption of Magnesia fil-@ Steinen .
<unk> <unk> Highly <unk> <unk>
( 135 ) refractory materials are of the utmost strategic importance for the steel industry .
the entire steel passes with Magnesia -@ stones walled out converters , ovens and pans .
Supply difficulties could therefore have significant consequences in the form of production interruptions , repairs or security problems .
For this reason , stones of high quality , i.e. a long service life , and good technical support for this type of product are very important .
due to the high technical requirements , a lot of time , high investments and research are required for the establishment of a supply relationship .
switching from one Chinese manufacturer to another manufacturer would be very difficult .
the steel producers claimed that in the last two years they made good progress with Chinese manufacturers and their introductors to the Community , especially by improving efficiency and innovation .
( 136 ) The undertakings objected to the introduction of measures shall therefore fear that there may be bottlenecks in the supply of high-quality stones and adequate technical support .
they are afraid that Chinese manufacturers would withdraw from the Community market in the event of the introduction of measures .
Furthermore , the largest occurrences of magnesite , the most important raw material for magnesia -@ stones , are located in the Republic of China .
the steel industry is therefore afraid that its relations with Chinese commodity suppliers could worsen .
( 137 ) However , as already stated above , the anti-dumping measures are not aim to prevent the import of the goods concerned or to make the activity of steel producers more difficult .
this means that non-harmful imports could be further imported into the Community .
Consequently , existing relations with Chinese leaders could be maintained even if anti-dumping measures were introduced against dumped imports .
This is also supported by the fact that the goods concerned have only such an insignificant share of the total production costs of the steel producers that measures on the costs of the users would have only minor effects ( cf . Recital 142 ) .
( 138 ) It should also be noted that the goods concerned are of strategic importance to the steel industry .
in the event of a waiver of measures , there is a risk that the entire production of the goods concerned will be transferred to the People &apos;s Republic of China in the long term .
Given that there are no major manufacturers in other third countries , such dependence on Chinese imports is clearly not a viable scenario for the steel industry
( 139 ) In addition , there is no evidence that the raw material access of the steel producers that produce Magnesia -@ stones for their own use could be made more difficult .
5.<unk> <unk>
( 140 ) The user industry claimed that the measures would strengthen a market structure with few major manufacturers .
the users argued that this lack of competition was the result of mergers and acquisitions in the Feuerfest -@ Industrie in the 1990s .
( 141 ) The largest manufacturer in the Community had a market share of around 30 % in the UZ , which is unlikely to be enough to control and control the market .
this is underpinned by the fact that this market share declined as a result of the imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
as stated above , these imports will in all likelihood continue even after the introduction of measures .
In addition , many small businesses in the community and even some steel companies themselves produce magnesia -@ bricks , and during the investigation , no evidence was presented that the major manufacturers in the community dominated the market in the alleged way .
since no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour has been presented , the claim remains unfounded and unproven .
5.<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
( 142 ) The steel industry also claimed that anti-dumping tariffs on Magnesia -@ Stones would incur additional costs in the highly price-sensitive steel market and above all in competition with steel producers from third countries .
For this reason , anti-dumping tariffs would affect the competitiveness of the steel industry , especially since the pressure on the markets for other raw materials for steel products is also very strong .
( 143 ) Nevertheless , the user industry &apos;s responses to the questionnaire show that Magnesia -@ stones account for well below 1 % of the total cost .
Consequently , the proposed anti-dumping tariffs would only have a marginal impact on the total cost of steel production .
the latest developments in the steel industry clearly show a recovery in sales prices and profitability , which further reduces the share of Magnesia fil-@ stones in total sales sales .
5.5 Conclu<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
( 144 ) In view of the foregoing , it is unlikely that anti-dumping measures on the Community market would cut the supply or affect competition , especially since the Chinese Magnesia -@ Stones should continue to maintain their market share .
the cost increase would only be marginal and would not significantly affect the competitiveness of the steel industry .
For these reasons , the view will be provisionally held that the interests of users do not speak against the introduction of measures .
6 <unk> <unk> clu<unk> <unk> Community <unk>
( 145 ) The introduction of measures vis-à-vis imports of Magnesia nor-@ Steinen originating in the country concerned was clearly in the interests of the Community industry .
As for the importers / retailers and user industries , any impact on the prices of the Magnesia crop -@ stones is likely to be minor .
By contrast , the market share and profitability losses of the Community industry and the decline in its prices are clearly more large .
( 146 ) In view of the foregoing , it is provisionally concluded that there are no compelling reasons against the introduction of anti-dumping duties on the imports of Magnesia -@ stones originating in the Federal Republic of China .
F. ANTIDUUMPINGMASAHMEN

( 147 ) In view of the conclusions on dumping , damage and Community interest , measures should be introduced to prevent further damage to the Community &amp; apos ; s dumped imports .
( 148 ) The customs duties shall be set at an altitude sufficient to eliminate the damage caused by these imports without exceeding the detected dumping range .
When determining the customs rate required to eliminate the effects of damaging dumping , it was assumed that any measures should allow the Community industry to cover its production costs and , altogether , an adequate pre-tax profit that could be achieved from an industry of this kind in the sector under normal competitive conditions , i.e. without dumped imports , in the sale of similar goods in the Community .
in this calculation , a profit margin of 8 % of sales was used on the basis of the profit margins prior to the occurrence of dumped imports .
on this basis , an unharmful price of the similar goods was determined for the Community economic sector .
the non-damaging price was determined on the basis of the production costs plus the aforementioned profit margin of 8 % .
( 149 ) The necessary price increase was then determined by a comparison of the weighed average import price with the non-damaging price .
import prices were corrected by 10 % upwards for three reasons .
Firstly , the production facilities of the Community industry were near the steel mills , while the cost of transport from the import port and insurance costs for imports were usually higher .
Secondly , the price charged by the Community industry to the respective steel mills for the sale also included technical support , which was usually not the case with the tors .
Thirdly , all sales of the Community industry were at the level of end consumers , while many import business were at the level of traders who had additional costs .
( 150 ) Any differences in the comparison were expressed as a percentage of the average cif fil-@ import value .
the comparison was carried out on the basis of the product groups formed according to PCN --@ numbers ( cf . Recital 11 ) .
( 151 ) The provisional weighed damage margins for companies granted either individual treatment or market economy status were :
- Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 17.1 % BAR
- Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 42.1 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Kyushu Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 21,9 % _ BAR _

- Yingkou Qinghua Refractories Co . Ltd . _ BAR _ 54.6 % _ BAR _
- Dashiqiao Sanqiang Refractory Materials Co . Ltd . _ BAR _ 66.1 % . _ BAR _
( 152 ) In connection with the calculation of the nationwide damage removal threshold for all other exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China , it should be taken into account that the cooperation was low .
For this reason , a range was calculated based on the data of those cooperating exporters who were granted neither MWB nor IB .
because this damage disposal threshold was lower than the highest damage margin in the case of the companies listed above , and in order not to reward the non-cooperation , the nationwide damage range was set at the level of the highest range determined above , i.e. 66.1 % .
2 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
153 ) On the basis of the foregoing , it was held that , in accordance with Article 7 ( 2 ) of the General Regulation , provisional anti-dumping tariffs should be imported on the imports of the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
in accordance with the rule of lower customs , the anti-dumping tariffs should be set at the amount of the dumping or damage range , depending on the one that the two is lower .
since the cooperation was low , the residual range in the amount of the highest for cooperating manufacturers , i.e. in the amount of 66.1 % of the cif -@ price free limit of the Community , should be fixed , unpaid .
the company-specific anti-dumping tariffs set out in this Regulation have been set on the basis of the findings of this investigation .

Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and dairy products &#91; 1 &#93; , in particular to Article 31 ( 14 ) ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> :
( 1 ) Commission Regulation ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 &#91; 2 &#93; has drawn up the nomenclature of agricultural products for export refunds .
( 2 ) According to the reimbursement clature , cheese is eligible for an export refund if they meet minimum requirements for dairy dry mass and milk fat .
a type of cheese produced in certain new Member States could meet these requirements , but could not benefit from a refund because it does not fall under the current export refund nomature classification system .
due to the importance of this cheese for the dairy industry , the trade and the respective milk producers , it is appropriate to add a product code under the position &quot; other cheeses &quot; , so that the cheese can be classified into the export refund nomenclature .
( 3 ) The quantities for which export licences are requested in the &apos; Cheese &apos; product category shall exceed the profile of the export restrictions applicable to the Community pursuant to the Convention on Agriculture concluded in the Uruguay trade negotiations of the Uruguay Round .
the additional export licences requested under the newly created position will increase pressure on this category .
( 4 ) According to Article 3 of Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 &#91; 3 &#93; , no reimbursement is granted for the export of cheese , the price of which is lower than EUR 230 per 100 kg before the application of the reimbursement in the export Member State .
However , this provision does not apply to code cheese 0406 90 33 9919 of the nomenclature of export refunds .
in these circumstances , in view of the numerous applications for granting export licences for cheese , it is appropriate to apply this provision to all types of cheese without exception .
( 5 ) In accordance with the footnote 10 applicable to grated , cheese in powder form and melting cheese in Annex I Sector 9 of Regulation ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 , non-milk components shall be taken into account when calculating the reimbursement .
this determination must be extended to all types of cheese and the relevant foreign milk components must be described in more detail .
for the execporter and to a greater extent for the competent authority , it can be very difficult or even impossible to determine the weight of these components .
it is therefore recommended to reduce the reimbursement by a standard amount .
( 6 ) The reimbursement shall be granted for the net weight of cheese .
in cases where the cheese is wrapped paraffin , ash or wax or wrapped in plastic wrap , there may be ambiguities .
it is envisaged that such an enclosure is not part of the net weight of the product for the purpose of calculating the refund .
for plastic foil , paraffin and ash it can be impossible for the export and the competent authority to determine the weight of these materials .
it is therefore recommended to reduce the reimbursement by a standard amount .
( 7 ) Regulations ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 and ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 shall be amended accordingly .

The Commission received an application in accordance with Article 13 ( 3 ) of the General Regulation to investigate the alleged bypass of the anti-dumping measures against imports of certain ring binder mechanics originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China ( hereinafter referred to as the &quot; Republic of China &quot; ) .
( 2 ) The application was submitted on 28 February 2005 by Ring Alliance Ringbuchtechnik GmbH on behalf of joint manufacturers , which accounts for more than 70 % of the joint production of certain ring binder mechanics .
B. <unk> <unk> <unk>
( 3 ) The goods affected by the alleged bypass are certain ring binder mechanics normally assigned to the KN N fil-@ code ex83051000 , originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
this KN site -@ code is only indicated for information .
( 4 ) The commodity which is the subject of the investigation are certain ring binder mechanisms sent from the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; examined goods &quot; ) and which are normally assigned to the same KN -@ code as the affected goods originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
C. <unk> MEASURES
( 5 ) The measures currently in force and possibly covered are a final anti-dumping duty introduced by Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2074 / 2004 &#91; 2 &#93; extended to the imports of the same goods shipped from Vietnam &#91; 3 &#93; .
d <unk> GREEN <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
( 6 ) The application contains sufficient evidence of appearance that the anti-dumping measures vis-à-vis the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China are bypassed by reloading the examined goods in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos and / or their montage in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> :
- According to the application , the trade structure has changed significantly due to a significant increase in the imports of the goods examined , while the imports of the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China declined after the introduction of measures , for which there is no sufficient justification or justification other from the introduction of the customs .
- This change in the trade structure seems to be due to the reshipment of certain ring binder mechanics originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China into the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos and / or the assembly of certain ring binder mechanics in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos .
- In addition , the application contains sufficient evidence of appearance that the remedy effect of the anti-dumping measures applicable vis-à-vis the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China is undermined both in terms of the quantity and prices .
Apparently , significant quantities of imports of certain ring binder mechanics from the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos have replaced the imports of the affected goods originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
- Furthermore , there is sufficient evidence of appearance that the examined goods are sold at prices that are dumped compared to the normal value originally determined for certain ring binder mechanics originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
- Should , in addition to the dispatch on the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos , other circumvention practices within the meaning of Article 13 of the General Regulation be established in the course of the investigation , the investigation may also extend to these practices .

7 . For the above reasons , the Commission has concluded that the evidence is sufficient to justify the opening of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the General Regulation and to record the imports of certain ring binder mechanics sent from the Democratic People &apos;s s Republic of Laos , irrespective of or not , their origin in the application is indicated with the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos in accordance with Article 14 ( 5 ) of the General Regulation .

( 12 ) As the alleged circumvention shall take place outside the Community , pursuant to Article 13 ( 4 ) of the General Regulation ( 4 ) , manufacturers of the goods concerned , who may prove that they are not connected to a manufacturer subject to the existing measures and for which it has been established that they are not involved in the circumvention practices within the meaning of Article 13 ( 1 ) and 2 ) of the General Regulation , may be exempt , from customs collection of imports or from measures .

<unk> regard <unk> <unk> <unk> Community Treaty <unk>
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 384 / 96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not belonging to the European Community &#91; 1 &#93; ( hereinafter referred to as &apos; Basic Regulation &apos; ) , in particular to Article 11 ( 3 ) ,
on a proposal from the Commission after consultations in the Advisory Committee ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> :
A. <unk> <unk> <unk> PROCE<unk> <unk>
( 1 ) On 5 May 2000 , the Commission opened an anti-dumping procedure &#91; 2 &#93; on imports of certain cables and ropes made of iron or steel originating in inter alia , Turkey .
( 2 ) This procedure ultimately led to the introduction of a final anti-dumping duty with Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 &#91; 3 &#93; in order to eliminate the damaging effects of dumping .
B. ANTRAG ON INDUCTION of an INTERIMM REPRENTATION
( 3 ) Has Çelik ve Halat Sanayi Ticaret A.S. ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; Has Çelik &quot; or &quot; applicant &quot; ) , a Turkish executive manufacturer of certain cables and ropes made of iron or steel subject to applicable anti-dumping measures , applied for a partial interim review of Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 .
4 . This request in accordance with Article 11 ( 3 ) of the General Regulation argued that the circumstances relating to the dumping on the basis of which the existing measures were introduced had changed and that these changes were permanent .
( 5 ) According to the application , the applicant made structural changes that had a significant impact on normal .
In addition , the applicant argued that a comparison of the normal value based on his expense or domestic prices with the export prices to the Community would result in a dumping range significantly below the applicable 17.8 % anti-dumping duty for the imports he produced .
Therefore , maintaining the measures at their current level , based on the previously determined dumping range , is no longer necessary to compensate for dumping .
( 6 ) After consultations in the Advisory Committee , the Commission concluded that there was sufficient evidence to justify the opening of a partial interim review so that it published a corresponding notice &#91; 4 &#93; and began with an investigation limited to determining the existence of dumping in the applicant .
<unk> <unk> CE<unk> <unk>
( 7 ) The Commission formally informed the representatives of the export country and the applicant of the opening of the partial interim review and gave all the parties concerned the opportunity to set out their position in writing and to request a hearing .
the Liaison Committee of the European Foundation of the Wire Rope Industries EWRIS ( the applicant in previous proceedings ) sent an opinion .
( 8 ) The Commission also sent a questionnaire to the applicant , which he answered within the deadline set in the announcement .
( 9 ) The Commission obtained all the information deemed necessary for the dumping investigation , examined it and carried out a inspection visit to the applicant &apos;s operation .
( 10 ) The dumping investigation concerned the period from 1 July 2003 to 29 February 2004 ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; Investigation Period &quot; ) .
d <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

homo<unk> <unk> <unk>
( 12 ) Like the previous investigation , the review also showed that the SWR , which the applicant produces in Turkey sells there or carries out into the Community , has the same basic material properties and uses so that they are to be regarded as a similar product within the meaning of Article 1 ( 4 ) of the General Regulation .
<unk> DU<unk> <unk>
<unk> mal
( 13 ) In the course of determining the normal value , it was initially examined whether the domestic sales of the similar goods made by the applicant were representative of the Community compared to its export sales .
this was the case because the quantities sold domestic , in accordance with Article 2 ( 2 ) of the General Regulation , met at least 5 % of its total export sales to the Community .
( 14 ) Subsequently , each of the types sold by the applicant on the domestic market , which , according to the results , were directly comparable to the types executed into the Community , investigated whether the domestic sales were sufficiently representative within the meaning of Article 2 ( 2 ) of the General Regulation .
this was considered given if the total amount of domestic sales of a type in the investigation period was at least 5 % of the total amount of export sales of the same type to the Community .
for most of the types exported to the Community during the investigation period , a comparable type sold in representative quantities on the domestic market could be determined .
( 15 ) For the types of goods that reached the 5 % threshold , it was then checked whether domestic sales could be regarded as transactions in normal trade by determining the share of profitable sales to independent customers .
in all cases , more than 80 % of the total domestic sales of the respective type were profitable , so the normal value was based on the weighed average of all domestic sales during the investigation period .
( 16 ) For the types carried out in the Community for which , according to the results , no comparable types were sold on the domestic market , the normal value in accordance with Article 2 paragraphs 3 and 6 of the General Ordinance was calculated on the basis of the manufacturing costs of by applicant for the executed types in question plus an appropriate amount for sales , administrative and overhead costs ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; VVG --@ costs &quot; ) and for profits .
the VVG de--@ costs were based on those recorded by the applicant for domestic sales of the similar goods .
the profit margin was based on those achieved by the applicant in the case of domestic sales of the similar goods in normal trade .

17 . As all exports of the goods concerned have been sold directly to independent customers in the Community , the export price was determined in accordance with Article 2 ( 8 ) of the General Regulation on the basis of the prices actually paid or paid .

( 18 ) The comparison of the normal value with the export price was carried out at the level from the factory and at the same trading level .
in the interest of a fair settlement , corrections were made on request in accordance with Article 2 ( 10 ) of the General Ordinance for demonstrably affecting prices and their comparability differences in the factors transport costs , insurance costs , provision , loading and ancillary costs , borrowing costs and commissions .
<unk> umping <unk>
( 19 ) In accordance with Article 2 ( 11 ) of the General Ordinance , the weighted average corrected normal value was compared with the weighed average net export price from the factory of the comparable type of goods to determine the dumping range for each type of product .
( 20 ) This comparison revealed that there was no dumping .
F. DURPATIONS CHANGE OF ENVIRONATIONS
( 21 ) In accordance with Article 11 ( 3 ) of the General Regulation , it was also examined whether it could be justifiably assumed that the circumstances had changed permanently .
( 22 ) In this respect , the investigation revealed that the applicant had made structural changes with a significant impact on production and organization , which resulted a significantly higher production efficiency and thus a decline in production costs , so that the normal value was lower compared to that in the investigation period of the previous investigation ( 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000 ) .
during the same period , export prices have risen and the investigation did not show any indications that this increase was only temporary .
( 23 ) It shall therefore be concluded that circumstances have changed in the long term , in particular to the increase in the prices of exports to the Community and the simultaneous decline in production costs .
g . ANTIDUMPINGMASSNAHMEN
( 24 ) Since no dumping has been detected , the measures should be removed vis-à-vis the applicant .
( 25 ) The interested parties were informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which amendment to Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 should be recommended and were given the opportunity to comment .
( 26 ) As a result , ERIS sent some general comments , which essentially concerned the rising raw material prices after the investigation period .
the EWRIS did not question the above dumping findings , but expressed the concern that the applicant might be able to practice dumping again .
( 27 ) With regard to raw ty prices , it should be noted that they may have increased after the investigation period , but this could not be taken into account in the dumping investigation for the applicant .
in the present case , the most important raw material is rolled wire , a simple steel product , whose prices usually fluctuate quickly .
therefore an increase in the prices of such a raw material cannot be seen as a permanent change that could invalidate the above findings .
In conclusion , it should be noted that the measures are only ted ted for the applicant and not Turkey as a whole , so that in accordance with Article 11 ( 6 ) of the General Regulation , the applicants remain included in the procedure and can be re-examined in the context of a later review carried out for Turkey -

by Regulation ( EC ) No 969 / 2000 &#91; 4 &#93; the Council amended the measures originally introduced by Regulation ( EEC ) No 3068 / 92 to imports of potassium chloride originating in inter alia Russia and extended their period of validity .
( 2 ) In March 2004 , by means of a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union &#91; 5 &#93; , the Commission launched on its own a partial interim review of the measures against the imports of potassium chloride originating in Russia , to examine whether the measures had to be amended as a result of the European Union &apos;s enlargement to 25 Member States ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; enlargement &quot; ) .
( 3 ) According to the results of this partial interim review , a temporary adjustment of existing measures was in the Community interests in order to prevent sudden and excessively negative effects on importers and users in the ten new Member States of the European Union ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; EU fil-@ 10 &quot; ) immediately after enlargement .
( 4 ) With Regulation ( EC ) No 992 / 2004 , the Council authorised the Commission to adopt commitments that meet the requirements laid down in paragraphs 27 to 32 of that Regulation .
On this basis , the Commission accepted commitments from two executive manufacturers in Russia in accordance with Article 8 , Article 11 ( 3 ) , Article 21 and Article 22 ( c ) of the General Regulation under Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 &#91; 6 .
( 5 ) In the case of an executive manufacturer , the Commission accepted a joint commitment for the imports of potassium chloride sold to the Community by JSC Uralkali , Berezniki , Russia , produced and exclusively by the distribution company Fertexim Ltd , Limassol , Cyprus .
( 6 ) JSC Uralkali informed the Commission that it would henceforth carry out its sales to the Community through another company called Uralkali Trading SA , Geneva , Switzerland .
therefore JSC Uralkali and Fertexim Ltd requested a corresponding amendment to Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 on the adoption of the joint commitment offer .
To this end , JSC Uralkali and Uralkali Trading SA have jointly submitted a revised commitment offer .
( 7 ) JSC Uralkali also pointed out that direct sales of JSC Uralkali to independent customers in the Community were not possible under the obligation adopted by Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 .
In the revised commitment offer , JSC Uralkali also undertakes to comply with its conditions in the Community for direct sales .
8 <unk> <unk> Commission examined <unk> <unk> <unk>
it concluded that the revised commitment met all the requirements laid down in Regulation ( EC ) No 992 / 2004 , namely that i would set the selling prices at a level that would effectively to the elimmedation of damage , ii the companies comply with certain quantities of import for sales to customers in the EU -@ 10 and in iii also essentially maintain their traditional sales patterns to individual customers in the EU -@ 10 .
Furthermore , it was concluded that - as claimed by JSC Uralkali - the transfer of distribution activities from Fertexim Ltd to Uralkali Trading SA did not affect the effectiveness of the obligation or , according to the information provided the companies , their effective monitoring .
( 9 ) JSC Uralkali &apos;s application for exemption of its direct sales to the Community from anti-dumping duties has been considered acceptable as it complies with the usual procedure of accepting proper commitments from manufacturers exuting directly to the Community .
( 10 ) In the light of the foregoing it was considered appropriate to amend the existing part of Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 -
