Pidge is right .
I am just a proverbs knocker .
I am not appointed leader .
now I am not even worthy to be a paladin .
what was it ?
this is the red lion .
you have to go to him .
never , Keith directed him to tear off my head .
does he call you ?
I would prefer nothing , but the red one is not for me .
-he chooses you .
-I don &apos;t understand .
my father created Voltron . but Zarkon is a better leader in battle .
Lance , when you accepted Keith as Voltron &apos;s new leader , showed that a strong team is more important to you than your urge for fame .
like my father .
I do not disappoint him .
Go .
there are still only three .
where is the rest of the gang ?
let &apos;s increase the pressure . Let &apos;s see who rushes to help .
Zethrid , shoot the black lion with the ion cannon .
why on the ?
there is something different about this lion .
his pilot does not have full control .
and Zethrid ? just a shot .
we do not want permanent damage .
Nice .
-eith , what should we do ?
-we attack .
can you be more precise ?
we need a plan !
Keith !
I &apos;m fine .
but we can &apos;t do it on our own .
not necessary .
now it is getting exciting .
-What was it ?
-The Old Teanic spaceship .
does anyone need help ?
Thank you , Coran .
Zethrid . You have been waiting for that .
bombard the Old Teanic ship with everything .
Yes , sir !
if anyone else is there , he will surely come out .
ok . Let &apos;s draw attention to the ship .
Mann .
the lion has it full !
be careful with him .
fly your own lion , Keith .
-That was intention !
-That runs far too chaotically .
we organize ourselves .
Keith , what should we do ?
we have to form Voltron , but we lack a lion .
no more .
-Allura ? -Yes !
awesome !
only see , there are now five kittens .
your orders , sir ?
shall we shoot ?
No , we have seen enough .
Retreat .
done !
it was on the verge , but yes , we made it .
Allura , you and the blue lion ?
how cool !
yes , that was a surprise , but a joyful one .
we now know that Zarkon has a son .
- This is deeply disturbing .
-we need to find out more .
bluer , we had some nice adventures .
I wanted to stay with you , but wishes are not always fulfilled .
I &apos;ll miss you , buddy .
pink ? not what I expected .
but I like it .
yes , on Altea we wear this color in honor of our fallen warriors .
I wear them in honor of the ancient paladins .
and Shiro .
that is yours .
I had to lose the blue unfortunately . at least to you .
- Princess !
the black lion flies away !
-eith , where do you want to go ?
Lotors Schiff is a tracking transmitter .
fetch all your lions .
we pursue them .
you wanted me to lead Voltron . That &apos;s how it works .
Lotor is on the other side .
in an hour we are close to attack .
good .
Keep Formation .
I am sorry .
is an attack now a good idea ?
not everyone gets along with his lion .
-Do you mean me ? -You ?
No !
No , certainly not .
but half of the team sits in new lions .
perhaps we should not take care .
tell our hot-headed leader .
you wanted me as leader , now you complain .
Lotor is the heir of the Galra @ Throne .
let us end his rule .
Allura , everything ok in the blue ?
yes , I flew half my life the castle -@ ship .
I just have to get used to the lion .
well . then we start the attack .
in a Varga the lions arrive .
your commands ?
we should turn and shoot .
we heard that all five lions are ready for action .
but otherwise we know little .
keep the ship on course until my return .
makes my hunter ready .
I attack the lions themselves .
you cannot defeat them alone .
I don &apos;t even intend to do that .
-There is a movement .
-so much for surprise .
this is just a hunter .
where are the others ?
They hide well .
we turn it off .
-Lance , what is that all about ?
-Excuse me !
the red one is unusually fast for me .
where did the hunter go ?
Come , move !
I can &apos;t shake it off .
drives him away .
I come .
-Allura !
- Sorry , Keith .
seriously , does the thing have brakes ?
Allura !
Allura !
what ?
he plays us off against each other .
- That must be Lotor . -Au !
Allura , everything ok with you ?
yes , but the control is not like the lock -@ ship .
what is going on , lion ? do what I command you .
move !
we should tell Allura that the lions work differently .
I told her not to roar at him .
there she shouted at me .
yes , forget it .
She scares me .
I can hear you !
-eith , what should we do ?
-if possible , do not get in my way !
great leader .
that doesn &apos;t work .
we have to form Voltron .
People , in formation flight .
People ?
the Voltron • -@ feeling does not arise .
continue !
it does not work !
-What is going on ?
- People !
the hunter !
how disappointing .
apparently the reality of Voltron does not do justice to the legend .
that was embarrassing .
and , let &apos;s leave it behind , fly back , reform ourselves , eat something ?
No !
I know we have difficulties , but Lotor must not escape .
Acxa . set course for the coordinates .
I will lure the lions there .
to the Thayserix ?
why ?
these are not the paladins that defeated father .
what ?
How do you know ?
They do not fight as a unit and cannot form Voltron .
my father did as much damage to the team as she did to him .
However , they are vulnerable , and we must take advantage of that .
we recalibrate your hunter for the atmosphere on Thayserix .
what ?
what happens on Thayserix ?
the planet consists of dense gases and has magnetic poles that affect normal sensors .
when the lions are there , they are blind .
nothing wrong , Narti .
keeps the cruiser in orbit around Thayserix .
I scare away the lions , and you grab them .
he hides .
we better not follow him , because what awaits us ?
Guys , we have a problem !
my sensors play crazy .
probably because of the atmosphere and the magnet of the planet .
we have no time for that .
he must not escape .
without the sensors and equipment we do not recognize where is up and down or how we come out .
-we should go back . -No !
continue to fly !
what ? I just heard &quot; fly . &quot;
do we fly back ?
do you hear a noise ?
I no longer see you .
Makes you slower !
-we have to stay there .
- He escapes .
-gases complicate radio contact .
we need to stay together to communicate .
we have probably survived the worst .
No ! No !
Allura was hit !
I fly after her .
Hunk !
you others stay with me !
Keith , we should take care of Allura .
Keith , you separate the team !
Keith , don &apos;t do that !
Stop playing with them !
finish it !
-is it all good ?
-Sorry that I slowed down . -the blue does not listen to me .
-Already ok .
our team holds together .
-or , Keith ?
-it &apos;s not just about the team .
the mission is more important than each individual .
we have to find Lotor and stop him . And that &apos;s exactly what I plan to do .
comes , people , we should stay together .
Prince Lotor needs your support on Thayserix .
we are waiting for you right here .
Lotor is directly above the lion .
and they have no idea .
why doesn &apos;t he shoot ?
he could tear them into shreds .
-Blow it up !
-That is not possible .
the area is full of red syntian @ nitrate , a highly explosive gas that reacts to increased light @ emissions .
that will be good .
this is crazy .
we see practically nothing .
stays together .
he must be somewhere here .
I know .
there !
-Where is he ? -Who knows ?
the radars do not work .
Guys . Do you also feel he is playing with us ?
I see it the same way , great .
the guy scares me .
-he lured us deliberately .
-Up there !
we have to leave !
this is a trap !
the leaf has turned .
the hunters become the hunted !
Hunk to knock sayings doesn &apos;t get us any further !
Lance is right .
stay calm , be ready .
he attacks .
forms a circle .
we have to be prepared for everything .
when you see him , you fire with everything you have .
Now !
Fire !
Hello ?
Paladins ? Help !
Wow , you can hide , but I will find you .
what happened ?
where is the rest of the team ?
that alone is my fault .
I am fully caught in his trap .
everyone warned me , but I didn &apos;t want to hear .
I put the whole team in danger .
yes , somehow .
but now we have to do that .
you are right .
we withdraw .
Hello ?
does anyone hear me ?
is there anyone ?
Pidge !
Hunk !
Oh my God .
I &apos;m glad I found you .
Do you repair the radar , find the rest and get us out of here ?
without data constant I can not calibrate , that would have gone before we flew into this gas @ planet .
and what does that mean ?
-That is , we are sitting in the clamp .
Hello ?
can anyone hear me ?
ok , stay calm , Allura .
Think .
what would Lance do ?
Hallihello , blue lion .
You know ... You are now really activating my particle lock .
nothing works .
I tried it with kind requests and orders .
what do you ask of me ?
I can &apos;t .
everyone relies on me .
the whole universe . but I can &apos;t control everything .
I ... I need your help .
I hear you .
help me .
lead me .
I can &apos;t make it alone .
a sonar card .
Do you also think what I think bluer ?
someone has learned something .
Come on .
almost .
Nitrate gas !
do the freezing beams work ?
I have no control over the left wing .
good , Paladin .
we made it , Blauer .
now we have to find the others .
Hey , Pidge .
if you had stranded on a planet and could still eat something ...
what would that be ?
a burrito ?
you like burritos .
I would take a burrito .
Hey , I call Pidge and Hunk .
- Are you looking for a way out of paladins ?
-Madness !
you have found us !
Allura has found you .
She has found us all .
-It connected with a lion .
-how did you do that ?
I behaved like Lance and stopped thinking .
yes , think like Lance .
- moment times , do you call me stupid ?
-No , you are a natural talent .
-Yes , of course stupid .
-from birth .
it &apos;s nice to raise Lance . -but we have to find out here .
- Follow me .
I know the way . Waits a tick .
we have company .
-Lotor has probably called reinforcement .
- Oh man , something is always .
we have to form Voltron .
but last time we could not make Voltron .
we have to try .
maybe we were too divided and unorganized , we only get out of here when we work together .
we are a team .
Shiro believed in us .
we must believe in ourselves .
do you think so ?
-Yes ! -so then ...
forms Voltron !
I recognize an unknown energy -@ signature .
-Hunk , I &apos;m one leg .
-Pretty cool , right ?
Lotor escapes .
shall we fly after him ?
No .
we brought ourselves into this situation through false ambition .
we must be ready for him .
understood , team leader .
where do we fly ?
Voltron is there at the back .
we have to fight now !
a leader knows when to leave the battlefield .
we determine when we face them .
You can form Voltron again .
is this a problem ?
No .
a chance .
-What is it ?
-Yes , we do not know this alarm .
Allura , what is ?
were you seeing the ghost ?
we have .
this is an ancient emergency call .
by King Alfors ships .
-are we not the last Alteans ?
moment .
what if that is a trap ?
this is an ancient Teanic ship , and we fly there .
this is a Tel @ Galax @ Exploration ship .
it explores the depths of space .
according to the identification code , the Traylings is a fleet cruiser .
but there is nothing to aim or mission here .
-What &apos;s wrong with him ?
-is this a wormhole ?
this is not a normal wormhole .
it generates enormous amounts of energy where the ship is stuck .
we see if someone is on board .
You need help .
we could send a drone that looks closer .
good .
the energy is neither radioactive nor thermal .
It also does not produce gravity , and the light radiates out , unlike black holes .
-but where does the light come from ?
-I know this energy – -@ signature .
this is quintessence !
not good .
ok , do we stay away from the thing , yes ?
is not possible .
haven &apos;t you just seen that ?
Voltron is much more stable than anything else in the universe .
we received an ancient Teanic distress signal , so there is someone on the ship .
as Paladins of Voltron we have to help .
but I still believe that this could be a trap .
and it is too dangerous to fly in anyway .
I fly alone when I have to .
ok , very slow .
Pidge , can you explain this to me before us ?
the Euclidean space around the ship is an anomaly .
but the energy does not come from a source that fits into our reality .
that was probably a no .
I scan for biorhythms .
strangely , I receive no signs of life .
maybe not here , but the ship is bigger .
-we have to go through there .
-through the glowing inferno ?
Pidge , keep an eye on Voltron &apos;s functions .
we stop immediately when it gets controversial .
then we immediately break off .
Guys , my sensors play crazy .
we should explode just like the drone .
but somehow does not affect the space curvature Voltron .
Hello ?
what can you see ?
the connection breaks off .
Hello ?
No !
we must be through . That is the nose of the ship .
Moment .
the rear part of the ship is gone .
Coran ! Coran !
we can no longer see the castle .
-Coran , do you hear me ?
and where does the planet come from ?
according to the sensors , we are exactly where we were .
Guys , that sounds strange now , but now I receive several biorhythms .
Alteaner .
it seems that there is only one way to find out what is going on .
Hello ?
is there anyone here ?
here it is totally scary .
does anyone think that is a ghost ship ?
or just me ?
has the crew given up the ship ?
unclear . but without the space suits they did not come ...
there is someone inside !
Thanks to King Alfor we found the second meteorite .
we have recovered it , but it causes severe disturbances .
we fly to Altea , but it is unclear whether we can do it .
at the moment ...
what happened here ?
something deadly .
that still does not explain the biorhythms .
Be careful !
-Not to be grasped .
Shiro ?
-like ...
back !
you never get the meteorite .
rather I die than leave it to old people .
Shiro , please .
my name is not Shiro .
What &apos;s going on here ?
why does he suddenly talk so strangely ?
-You know us ?
-Of course !
you are our leader and a paladin .
and you are Slav .
I have delivered you .
and you are crazy .
-That may be true , but you never freed me from anything .
or ...
this is a parallel universe .
what please ?
when we flew through the energy field , we landed in a parallel universe .
something Slav always talks about ?
not you .
but another .
-he constantly talks about other realities .
-seems familiar to me .
you were attacking the crew ?
-Back , old woman .
-we do not .
but it is good that they are dead .
-Oh no , even more Alteans !
-What ?
even more Alteans ?
They have noticed your arrival .
Sven , away here !
disappears .
What &apos;s going on here ?
is that a bunch of Alteans boarded the ship ?
Weapons gone !
Alteaner .
impossible .
Empress .
I am confused .
how was that ?
are you Empress Allura ?
I am Princess Allura .
please rise .
I am Commander Hira , Empress .
how can that be ?
you crushed the Galra uprising . You founded our empire . 10,000 years ago .
where we come from Zarkon destroyed your planet and wiped out the Alteans .
where do you come from ?
fascinating .
your theory about Voltron has been confirmed .
I had hoped to experience a bigger fireworks display .
all previous recovery @ attempts were more entertaining .
Well , not for your pilots .
Voltron got through because he is made of the same material as the meteorite King Alfor wanted to hide from his father .
let &apos;s see if the new paladins bring it to us .
and when Voltron is trapped in the other dimension ?
in the other reality , Ezor .
and when Voltron is trapped in the other reality ?
Voltron is stuck there , we are rid of him .
he comes back with the meteorite , we get it .
for us both are a victory .
this is the meteorite that Trayling spoke of .
he is stuck between the realities . Like the ship .
can you take a sample ?
I try .
incredible .
this is Voltron .
what ?
of course it is not really Voltron , but the energy waves are the ones Zarkon was looking for .
and those who led us to the blue lion .
so you could get into this reality .
Your vehicle is made of the same transreal material .
that &apos;s why Voltron is so powerful .
with this material , Altea can build its own transreal ships .
we can extend our peace to all realities .
General Hira , I discovered something on the ship that secured Alteas rule over millennia .
the Alteans of this reality have defeated the Galra ?
under your leadership , Empress .
had you not fought and avenged your father , Altea could never have made peace throughout the universe .
that is the last .
do you think the plan works ?
don &apos;t worry .
I am 60 % sure this is one of the 0.15 % realities in which this plan works 100 % .
whether people from the other reality help the Alteans ?
if they are really my friends , it is 72 % likely that they will decide correctly .
Since then we have brought the true peace of Altea to all worlds .
that is wonderful .
no stress , no wars .
-That &apos;s unimaginable . -really ?
take Moxilous .
For centuries his people waged war against his neighboring planets .
what a barbaric life .
but look at him now .
what is different ?
the hoctril .
the greatest technical achievement of our civilization .
what does he do ?
he deprives our enemies of their fighting power .
their will , one could say .
we are on .
who was still lost in Empress Allura &apos;s time is rehabilitated .
Peoples who have waged war for millennia can now live in peace and support our new order .
as part of the Old Tean peace movement ?
are we talking about slavery ?
No .
they are not slaves without will .
Slaves flee constantly or rebel .
the controlled like to do what they are told .
the protection of life is a top priority in our empire .
and with this we achieve more than we have ever dreamed .
but you take away their free will .
the will that would kill you without hesitation .
Thanks to us , no innocent man must die by the free will of an evil being .
Empress Allura , I &apos;ll show you something .
this is our Altea .
comes with us .
let me show you all his splendor .
does anyone else find these guys oblique ?
something is wrong with these Alteans .
they almost smashed the brain of the big guy .
Huhu , up here .
how did you find us ?
-the probability was great ...
-All right , forget it .
we have to get away to Keith and Allura and the meteorites .
we are on it .
but you have to help us with one thing .
perfect .
I suspected that Gamara forces are on board .
but not that Empress Allura &apos;s friends help them .
See Altea again .
it seemed an unrealizable dream I never dared to dream of .
Allura , that &apos;s not the Altea you knew .
that is true .
this Altea has prevented the Galra from spreading throughout the universe , as with you .
Empress , we will do everything to help you .
the meteorite on this ship can travel between realities .
If you activate this ship , we can free the ship and the meteorite from the crack .
then we fly into your universe and bring you peace . even the Galra .
think about it well , Allura .
Recently we thought all Galra was evil .
maybe it &apos;s not as easy as she does .
Keith , this is my people . This would be the strongest alliance we have .
I tried everything .
I can &apos;t find Voltron .
how should I stop them ?
you know them .
I don &apos;t understand a word , but I suppose it was an insult .
not good .
, Allura .
soon we carry our peace into every reality .
What is that all about ?
Empress , the forces of Gamara are on board .
They helped them .
release our friends .
Hira , you and all of Altea have turned the universe into a slave empire .
no one is free .
Slaves ?
is that true ?
the controlled are not slaves .
and you spread chaos and destruction !
we will scan your brain and find out where the rebels are .
finally the war can end .
-Allura , we must not allow that .
-Hira , please .
we both want the same .
Peace .
Oh yes ?
through your weakness your people suffer from the Galra .
but we gave our peace .
and now we bring peace to every reality .
you are not my empress .
and you are not an old woman .
what to laugh about ?
we are in reality where everything goes well .
perfect timing .
on him !
los .
-idge , where are the lions ?
-left down !
Sven , everything ok ?
you have saved me .
that will be again .
just takes me to the hospital .
we are stuck . To all :
Hold on !
does he do this in every reality ?
I take care of Sven .
get your lions !
I am to blame .
I activated the spaceship .
They get the meteorite and terrorize every reality .
No , you can recapture the meteorite !
-Pidge , search the meteorite .
-I have already located his signature .
we fly in and fetch it for us .
forms Voltron !
ok , and what now ?
we can only return at the point of our arrival .
shoot down !
-Activate drive .
drive ready .
what is going on ?
Drive failed .
Persecution impossible .
I love this reality !
destroy them !
I have it !
No !
you are back !
thanks to the ancestors !
Paladins , you hear me ?
all ok ?
nice that my emergency signal lured you , Voltron .
you hear me ? everything ok ?
Coran , we are still alive .
Allura , you have done the right thing .
Hira was not allowed to have the meteorite .
-but now Lotor has him .
-You could not imagine that .
that is the problem .
we are always unaware .
therefore my father sent away the lions .
to protect them from this reality .
-Finally I understand it .
-we get it back .
and if not ?
Lotor is always one step ahead of us .
he has something to do with the meteorite , and if he succeeds , the Galra have a weapon as deadly as Voltron .
ok , people , target targeted .
I give you cover ... Hey , Keith , I would have caught him !
there are still some coming !
that was awesome !
Pidge , could you accelerate ?
almost ...
done !
super , Pidge .
-This is the last outpost here .
-Contacts the blade of Marmora .
tells them the base is liberated .
Well , I only know how Zarkon wanted to steal the lion and I should use the Bayard .
after that I know nothing more .
I only woke up on the Galra @ ship .
you have activated the black lion teleportation mode .
did he teleport you ?
maybe he wanted to help you .
by handing me over the Galra ?
perhaps Zarkon manipulated him .
he tried to control the lion until the end , right ?
yes , maybe .
So as soon as you feel grown , others are definitely happy to see you .
They need you .
yes , I try .
ok , we are on the bridge .
-Hey , Keith ?
-Yes ?
how many times will you save me before all this is over ?
as often as I have to .
good work , people .
you have brought the decisive turn .
good that you have remained faithful to the mission .
you look good .
how are you ?
well , except for the funny headaches .
Guys , I have something .
I downloaded data from the fallen Galra @ base .
I decrypted them and found something about Lotor .
-Do you know where he is ?
-No . But his command ship was sighted in the Va &apos;Kar @ quadrant .
well done , Pidge .
but these quadrants are huge .
how shall we find him ?
the comet is made of the same material as Voltron .
I scan for Fraunhofer – @ lines , as with the blue lion .
which are subject to free induction decay .
which is exponential .
but when we amplify the sensors ...
No , too many interferences .
-Let &apos;s increase the radiance .
-tips of the lock !
awesome !
I just understood the train station .
we are now setting course for the Va &apos;Kar @ Quadrant .
it hurries .
who knows what Lotor intends to do with the comet ?
yes ?
Hey , man , I wanted to talk to you briefly because ...
because I am worried .
definitely , if you come to me with it .
-you are now finally the leader .
-Treasures already .
I expected .
we are now six paladins , but we have only five lions .
you are right .
Shiro takes over the black one , you want your red one .
and I would have to take away Allura the blue one .
but she learns faster than all of us .
It could achieve unexpected things .
that is true .
so I would do the team a favor if I said goodbye .
What are you talking about ?
this is not about ego .
we have war .
it is necessary to choose the best .
do not break your head and think of the mission .
that will happen .
ok , thank you .
And , Lance leaves calculating Pidge .
Thank you for joining in .
I would never have come there .
I know you are dirty .
I owe you a shower .
but first we are looking for Lotor , yes ?
let &apos;s throw at the thing and see if it goes .
perhaps the polarity is not true .
People .
I have the comet , but it moves .
Coran ?
Allura ?
can an old man push the castle ?
we are on it .
we catch up .
keep a distance so that we are not noticed .
the signal stopped in the Ulippa @ system .
activate scanners .
this is not Lotor .
but the comet is in there .
1xProtective Cover for S ...
1xProtective Cover for S ...
Oh , I &apos;m sorry .
Get started , Shiro .
we need the comet .
he should safely enter the base .
it is vulnerable during transport .
we strike .
who , to the vulture , are these guys ?
a transport is probably not the plan .
-we need more detailed information .
-take the black lion .
I support you with Coran .
Keith , are you sure ?
yes .
-What is going on ?
-Shiro , where are you ?
we need you !
-eith , you have to lead the mission .
-What ?
why ?
the black lion does not react .
you are probably his paladin now .
I come .
this is the worst base in the empire .
but it is my base !
Victory or death !
we have to find the comet first .
then we find out who the guys are .
you have taken effect ?
Lotor sends you to finish what he started ?
we are on board .
no trace of the crew .
we look further .
here long .
I kill him !
-No , you know the plan !
My life is unimportant .
only the empire counts !
switch off systems .
sounds like the battle is over .
quickly .
I open the roof .
Coran , enlarge the picture .
is the ...
the Teludav !
what , in the name of King Groggerys the frail , shall that ?
he must be here .
right in front of us .
where is the comet ?
in the ship ?
I think the ship is the comet .
he quickly built a ship from the ore of the comet ?
-That &apos;s bad .
-Terrible even .
People ...
in the Galra @ base there is a part of the Teludav .
who wormed Zarkon &apos;s ship ?
but they can &apos;t serve it without Old Teanic ...
Zarkon &apos;s witch !
She had Old Teanic times .
-Does anyone freak out here ?
-Yes , I sign up for flipping out .
Lotor must be here .
we finally have to turn it off .
Lotor must not have the ship .
back to the lions , and shapes Voltron !
why destroy the ship when we can turn off Lotor ?
he constantly outwits us .
That is why Lotor must not get this ship .
too dangerous .
Keith , I want to stop Lotor too , but Shiro is right .
ok , go to the lions .
I &apos;m looking for Lotor .
Keith , you have to stay together .
-I agree with Shiro . -I too .
-I too .
-Yes .
Well , then go .
I help you !
Pidge , help me !
I rarely fight worthy opponents .
To destroy you will give me joy .
we have no time for it .
to the lions !
good idea .
Zethrid , stop !
Come on !
we can finally destroy them .
we have what we wanted .
stick to the plan .
seriously . What is going on here ?
who are they ?
I saw one of them in the weblum .
She stole Scaultrit .
and they have an old man ?
You want to open worm holes with the Teludav .
was the ship out of the comet , we have completely different worries .
I thought Lotor took over for Zarkon .
why does he attack a base ?
no idea , so we must finally stop him .
-we have to stop the transport ship .
-Is made .
-That must be the ship from the comet .
-Caution .
Lift up particle barrier and defence systems .
-a fast , small bastard .
and a damn more agile .
-the particle barrier is damaged .
-People , where are you ?
another hit , and it &apos;s over !
forms the sword !
occupy Voltron until the ship is out of range .
do not be provoked .
the sword is deadly .
it &apos;s too fast !
People escaping the cargo ship with the Teludav .
I thought we should destroy the comet -@ ship .
but Lotor must not have the Teludav .
Shiro is right .
we destroy it .
but the comet is in front of our nose !
Keith , the cargo ship escapes !
good so .
They must defend themselves or pursue the Teludav unprotected .
-the Teludav escapes !
-eith , what now ?
lowers the shield and shoots at the cargo ship . Risks it .
or we hit this first and then the cargo ship .
no time !
you have to decide !
Hunk , your Bayard .
we lower the shield and shoot at the cargo ship .
-ready ?
-ready !
They attack the cargo ship .
make you ready for fire .
go !
Fire !
again !
Your failure is extremely disappointing .
comes back before even more Galra @ ships appear .
So Lotor attacked the Galra @ base to steal the Teludav ?
how confusing .
no matter they escape !
-Afterwards . -No .
comes back to the castle .
we have to get out of what is going on here .
- Sorry that I interfered .
-I thought I had it under control .
you have to learn to set priorities .
sometimes it hurts .
-I am not suitable for the leader .
-Yes , you do .
Thanks to your quick reaction , Lotor did not escape with the Teludav .
you grab that .
the black lion has chosen you .
I am proud of you .
I just know these people had the right access codes .
you have to believe me !
I do . Nevertheless , you have to pay for your failure .
Ulaz ?
Operation Kuron , phase one successful .
Start phase two .
Come on !
Come on !
Message to the command center .
Operation Kuron , phase three has started .
General Rath ...
-I have an order for you .
-I stand in the services of Galra .
Lotor &apos;s perception has not been so clear since he returned .
it was risky to bring him back after his absence .
I am worried about the path he has been following since then .
you have to keep an eye on him .
Follow his battlecruiser and tell me any suspicious behavior .
Vrepit sa .
what killed you ?
Help .
that must be the one who crashed with his pod .
Experimental subject Y0XT39 reacts normally to optical stimuli .
approved for operation Kuron .
-What does he say ?
-hard to say , but he comes out .
-What kind of noise is this ?
-I look .
he wakes up .
-Did you put the clamp on him ?
-Which one ?
otherwise his arm turns into a weapon .
-the red ?
-we have only one clamp !
where am I ?
why am I connected ?
-Do we eat it ?
-he doesn &apos;t look like a galra .
-Then we don &apos;t eat it ?
-No .
-I am not a Galra .
-All the worse .
a traitor .
I am not a ...
you are ...
You are rebels .
is true .
we fight against the Galra .
we did not ally with them !
I do not work for that .
I am on your side .
I am Shiro , a paladin of Voltron .
but I was captured .
I suppose .
-I fought against Zarkon .
-Against Zarkon ?
Of course , and I am the Phloban of Gargalax .
please , have you never heard of Voltron ?
the lion .
what happened to them ?
how much time has passed ?
the Galra have been sending spies to us for years .
and now they have sent you to listen to us ?
a joke .
No , I fled .
you fled from a Galra @ battleship ?
-I won &apos;t buy it from you !
-it is true .
I took a pod .
They fired on me and hit my pod .
they do not do that with allies .
Please . check my identity at the blade of Marmora or at Voltron .
-with a traceable signal ? No .
- Take a look around .
our supplies here are limited .
we like to watch you starve until you finally tell the truth .
Prince Lotor , the scanners recognize again an anomaly .
exact coordinates .
I want to see them .
nothing .
what do you expect ?
three such phenomena in one day cannot be a coincidence .
Persecutors ? -We know that .
-except they have scanners -@ protocols .
-Then they distort the measurements .
-Only the Galra can access them .
activates the heat @ sensors and fires around the anomaly .
why ?
we shoot them down !
I want to know who that is .
it is a Galra -@ battleship .
we bring our guest on board .
No !
Lotor needs support on Thayserix .
we are waiting for you right here .
-Thayserix ?
where is that ?
-Not far from here .
They cross the quadrant .
record this with the Klygarg .
I hate the Klygarg .
how does it work again ?
enter your password . -Clear .
what is my password ?
-don &apos;t know , it &apos;s yours !
I intercept another message .
-Record them too .
-I didn &apos;t even record the first one .
Prince Lotor gave us an order .
we should intercept Voltron .
Voltron ?
see if he is willing to talk .
Vakala !
Come here !
we should have eaten it .
he is injured .
it cannot be far .
I &apos;m looking outside , you in the tunnels .
I will not hurt you !
please do not shoot !
you never meet !
Let me ! -here with it !
-No , it belongs to me !
stop immediately , otherwise I will shoot !
you are on the wrong side of war .
No , that is not true .
I am on your side .
my name is Shiro , and as I said , I am a paladin of Voltron .
it doesn &apos;t matter what I say . You don &apos;t believe me , so ...
I have to go back to my team and I need your help .
Thayserix .
a gigantic gas planet .
according to the news we intercepted , Voltron is there ... or he was there .
-I have to go there .
were you getting a ship ?
-Only one shuttle to dock on ships in orbit , not to cross space .
here , excuse me for hanging you on the wrist .
Thank you .
I &apos;m sorry the gun hit your face .
Oh , that was neither the first nor the last time .
Shiro , I see no way for you to Thayserix .
-What about the Galra @ Kreuzer ?
-What about it ?
he flies close by , I smuggle myself on board .
aboard a Galra @ Cruiser ?
you first came from a Galra @ ship . And now you want to break into one ?
you &apos;re crazier than me .
and I live voluntarily on an ice planet .
is it possible or not ?
the cruiser is within range , but it jumps right into the Hyper @ Drive .
I hurry .
Thank you for your help .
whether he makes it to the battleship and then to Voltron ?
he is the one he claims to be , he has a chance .
you know it was our only ship ?
the cruiser identifies the shuttle as soon as it is within range .
because the shuttle is so small , the bridge is not informed .
the defense system destroys everything in visual contact .
the sensors identify you as a space debris .
you have to be fast .
go to the blasters .
there you come on board .
the weapons are retracted before the Hyper @ Drive .
Leave Hyper – @ Drive . Activate shields .
an attack !
Visual contact with Voltron .
Voltron is within reach .
Voltron .
Make fighter squadron one ready for use .
is already coming .
sends the fighter squadron .
go !
Voltron is out of reach .
Fighter squadron , cancel action .
Cancel action .
now or never .
Voltron !
go , movement !
he &apos;s too fast for me !
No !
keep your henchmen from my neck .
Just like your father , the Galra @ Empire needs clear guidance in these difficult times .
I am the ruler .
but I am not my father .
Pilots – @ logbook .
I am a day away from Thayserix .
I have lost visual and radar contact with Voltron .
I keep my course .
I am four days away from Thayserix .
no food or water .
SOS • -@ signal is activated .
no signs from anyone .
I am on the road for seven days .
the oxygen is running out , the fuel is consumed .
that will be my last entry .
what is going on ?
we have found it .
Master , I ask forgiveness , but I know no other way .
Your empire needs you .
there we fought , there were his generals , there he stole the meteorite .
Lotor could be anywhere .
without knowing what he is up to , we will never find him .
what are the connections ?
why is Voltron made of the same material as the meteorite ?
what is so special about it ?
Father discovered a meteorite before my birth .
Your father . and Zarkon .
when Zarkon was paladin of the black lion ?
even before .
before Alfor built the lions .
it hurts to talk about it , but since we want to stop Lotor , we have to hear the rest .
In the beginning , the paladins were five great leaders , although they came from cultures that were very different and have been waging war for generations , they added their differences to protect their common interests .
which was in the beginning rather a purpose alliance , developed into a friendship .
They kept away from those who would harm them .
Oje .
I always warn you against going it alone , Alfor .
as an alchemist you are much wiser than a soldier .
for that I have you , Zarkon .
the original paladins were Zarkon of Daibazaal ,
King Alfor of Altea , Gyrgan of Rygnirath ,
Trigel vom Dalterion ◀ -@ Gürtel und Blaytz von Nalquoud .
sit down , eat and drink with us !
Fraternization with the servant class is not allowed .
because of the discipline .
a little less discipline would do you good , Zarkon .
I remember when Lambonit @ looters surround you .
-I had the gang under control .
-the gang had you under control .
why do I only engage with these crooks ?
because we are the only crooks on your side .
on us !
at Rygnirath .
They did not suspect that after that night the universe would be different forever .
we evacuated all Galra ’ -@ inhabitants at the crater .
-What did you find out ?
-I don &apos;t know .
this meteorite is different from the others .
-His material changes the realities .
-What do you mean by that ?
Scholars have always had the theory that several realities exist .
whole other universes with stories of which we know nothing .
but you could never prove it .
until now , because when we moved the meteorite we discovered this here .
is this another reality ?
-What is it ?
-No fear .
this is Kova .
-it comes from our reality .
-Zarkon . This is Honerva .
She is the best alchemist of Altea .
I invited her to Daibazaal . as head of research .
Their expertise is priceless .
isn &apos;t that exciting ?
it could turn the understanding of the universe upside down .
well , find out everything you can .
I give you all the support .
I have to go .
that was short .
King Alfor experimented with ore on Altea , while Honerva continued to research the abyss on Daibazaal .
but Alfor often came to visit , and the years passed .
Zarkon . This is Princess Allura .
very pleased .
a gift in honor of your birth , princess .
Honerva has tamed you .
I never thought that the great warrior would marry Zarkon , and an ancient alchemist .
Honerva , diligent as always .
Thank you for the gift .
Allura likes it .
-That was just a common gesture .
-Of course .
-What does the quintessence -@ experiment do ?
-it is running .
one year with a drop of quintessence , without loss of revolutions per debosch .
there is no comparable energy source .
my ships work according to the same principle . the ore develops by itself .
it is somehow terrifying .
infinitely strong spaceships for the Galra @ Empire .
and an endless source of clean energy for the universe .
of course .
what is it ?
I sent signals to the neighbor – @ reality . and this creature reacted to it .
nothing from our universe survived the passage through the transition .
-but this being came through unscathed .
-What ?
I thought we wanted to be careful .
we don &apos;t know what &apos;s out there .
Earlier it was believed that lightnings came from the arrows of the gods until other was proved .
in our pursuit of knowledge we penetrate into dangerous terrain .
Alfor and Honerva built a particle @ barrier around the crater to stop the creatures .
but it would not last forever .
the barrier weakens .
we have little time .
if the creatures come out there , my troops will be overrun .
my planet , my people .
-Alfors project will save us .
-Let &apos;s hope so .
I hope your plan works , Alfor .
at Rygnirath !
incredible .
Alfor , they are fantastic .
how do they work ?
I formed them from the meteorite -@ ore and quintessence .
impressive !
the alloy with the meteorite -@ ore makes it almost indestructible .
what armament do they have ?
now it becomes really interesting .
Old Teanic alchemy can create great feats .
but when I tested my spaceship , I suddenly felt a kind of psychological connection .
how can I explain it ? the ship not only read my thoughts .
it communicated with me .
They develop .
we do not know their abilities , but we understand it over time .
over time ?
time escapes , and we stand here .
Creatures of another empire soon slaughter my people .
without these spaceships all hope is lost !
Understand .
that will be hard work .
these are not ordinary spaceships .
you do not choose the lion .
the lion chooses you .
be careful at the beginning .
They have greater energy than anything you know .
lead the formation .
you understand the ships best .
I am an alchemist , not a military leader .
-I keep your right hand .
-now good .
on my sign , Paladine !
right Alfor and Blaytz !
left trigel and gyrgan !
Paladins , I fly ahead and distract him .
you attack others from all sides !
Fire !
continue to fire !
these stupid things block me !
Blaytz !
-Thank you , Alfor !
-Always happy .
Head kick - @ screw !
-I don &apos;t meet !
-Retreat , paladins !
we are reforming .
Wait !
we form a new formation .
-What ? why ?
-I don &apos;t know , but I feel it .
-Hey , I feel it too !
-I too !
what is going on here ?
Voltron .
-Unbelievable , we made it !
-how did that come about ?
am I one leg ?
-these forces are just incredible .
-This is Voltron .
a sign !
well done , trigel !
-it wants to crush us !
-we have to get rid of it !
I know what we are doing .
we seal the transition .
seal the transition ?
why ? he almost destroyed Daibazaal !
the creatures almost destroyed Daibazaal , but you defeated them .
Zarkon , you certainly agree with me .
it must be sealed .
maybe not .
just see what we &apos;ve won , Alfor .
your spaceships are the most powerful machines .
what else do we discover when we continue to work ?
you risk your planet , the whole solar system ? -What for ?
for more power ?
-you know it &apos;s about more .
we already have Voltron .
that is enough .
I have the say here !
I &apos;m sorry , Alfor .
the work continues .
Honerva continued her experiments at the transition .
Despite its differences , Zarkon , Alfor and the Paladins established a new era of peace and prosperity .
Voltron gained fame as a defender of the universe , and the legend arose that lives on to this day .
I heard there were three more earthquakes .
do not worry , I stabilize the planets -@ cohesion .
my scientists scanned Daibazaal .
the planet disintegrated .
the integrity ...
I don &apos;t stop Honerva &apos;s work now .
She discovers more every day !
her team developed a space cruiser five times larger than our ships .
-but that &apos;s not all .
-Hello , Honerva .
it is Deca • -@ Phoebs her .
I hope you don &apos;t come to finish my work .
there is more knowledge and power in this gap than you can ever understand .
I &apos;m just worried about stability ...
is that Kova ?
how old is he now ?
28 Deca • -@ Phoebs .
after the creatures attacked , he fell ill .
but then I treated him with quintessence .
No .
he revealed the truth to us .
Quintessence is so much more than you understand .
-It is life itself .
-you went too far .
you coward .
Honerva , you ...
you want to prevent enlightenment .
we should increase the passage .
with Voltron we facilitate access to the other reality .
this is insanity !
Quintessence poisoned your mind .
that &apos;s just the surface .
we can rule the universe ! -we can live forever !
we all !
-I don &apos;t want to be a part of that .
you are only a part of Voltron , Alfor .
do not hold us all back for fear .
Alfor , I lead the paladins !
you follow my orders !
Alfor !
Honerva ?
Honerva !
we have to ...
we must have it .
we must have it . Come back .
-Come back .
-What is it , my beloved ?
Quintessence .
Quintessence is life .
into the transition .
what ?
we must ... we must ...
Voltron .
Voltron .
that is the only way .
Alfor tried to warn me , but I didn &apos;t hear .
now my wife has become sick , and my planet is about to disintegrate .
I implore you , my faithful companions , to accompany me on a dangerous mission .
we have to seal the transition , and Voltron has to .
we will help you .
I hope it is not too late to save my planet , and our friendship .
Alfor &apos;s compassion for his comrade blinded him to Zarkon &apos;s true plans .
According to Honerva , we can only close the transition with the power of the quintessence .
for this we must first increase the opening .
-how is that supposed to work ?
-with the sword .
Form sword !
-That &apos;s too hard .
-Concentrate !
where are we ?
in transition .
No !
Zarkon , what are you up to ?
-we have to take them away here !
-Fast .
the creatures have returned !
everywhere !
Fire lasers !
Trigel , grab her !
Gyrgan , Blaytz , tax missiles !
away here !
Zarkon &apos;s attempt to save Honerva was in vain .
both succumbed to the radiation overload of the quintessence .
Zarkon had deceived the paladins .
They had enlarged the transition , which further destabilized Daibazaal .
King Alfor was forced to evacuate the planet .
he made the transition in the only way he knew .
he destroyed the home of the Galra .
King Alfor established a state funeral for Zarkon and Honerva .
but what happened there , he could never have imagined .
-Where am I ?
-on board your ship , sir .
brings us home .
I can &apos;t , sir .
Daibazaal was destroyed .
my Galra @ companions .
King Alfor of Altea has destroyed our planet .
he will pay dearly for his crimes .
join your Emperor !
Revenge will be ours !
Zarkon became evil par excellence , obsessed with quintessence .
for a new opening between the realities he needed Voltron .
and so the war began .
the Galra immediately followed their leader and attacked .
the planets were not prepared for this .
soon they were all conquered except Altea .
in order not to let Voltron fall into Zarkon &apos;s hands , the lions were sent to distant corners .
Zarkon raced with anger .
he killed King Alfor . He atoned for the loss of Daibazaal with the destruction of Altea .
so this is Lotor &apos;s plan .
into other universes . -to get the purest quintessence .
-no matter how . we have to stop him .
my husband , how could I forget that ?
you brought me back to life .
now I &apos;ll get you back .
since I know I would like to have Julia as a girlfriend , I want to look good whenever I see her .
so what is important to girls . but looking good is hard .
Well , look at one .
the rocker on the pedestal .
I mean your hairstyle .
that makes no sense .
I have no rocking - @ hairstyle .
Cocks do not even have hair .
They have a cockscomb of skin .
that &apos;s the red thing on their heads , isn &apos;t it ?
yes .
Hahnenkamm .
Funny Word .
As for birds , chickens are not as cool as penguins , but they have interesting behaviors .
in a natural environment , the cock attracts the hen to mating by spreading his feathers and performing a dance .
God .
- Leave that alone .
I rub off too much else .
- Why so terrible ?
yes .
the lemon slices look very tasty .
Finger away . They are for the group .
all clear .
they look fantastic .
it lowers a wing and dances circular around the female .
Shit , Casey .
this is a real man !
already fucked , or are you still fumbling ?
yes , of course .
Casey is totally prudish .
She hasn &apos;t even kissed a guy .
you didn &apos;t tell anything about a friend .
why don &apos;t you tell me about it ?
he is not my friend , we just depend .
with his penis .
is that true ?
- Do you depend on his penis ?
- No , Sharice .
hau off .
but encouraging girls to mating or having them as a girlfriend requires other skills .
research is necessary .
you can &apos;t just ask a girl for a date .
you have to learn important things about them beforehand .
what is your favorite lemonade ?
the normal .
do you like movies ?
yes , I love movies .
do you have fears or phobias ?
- No .
- What is your favorite • -@ winter sports ?
Well , we were snowshoeing a few times .
&quot; We , &quot; so you and your mom .
me and my friend .
Snowshoeing was his idea .
I hate the cold .
You have a friend ?
Miles .
Anyway , it &apos;s great that you show interest in others .
we have worked on this .
but let us come back to you .
So when Mr. Tavern &apos;s voice bothers you ...
when I was excited or stressed as a child , I hit my head somewhere or screamed .
Today I prefer substitute actions .
Sam .
is everything fine ?
do you want to talk ?
I should talk to Mom .
that &apos;s how it usually works , but Mom is with the group today .
maybe I can help .
I like a girl .
honest ?
- That is good .
how is it ?
- She is clever , and she is pretty .
and she has a friend , Miles .
cursed Miles .
Well , that &apos;s crap .
but you know , this is not the end of the world .
Mom had one when I met her .
- In fact ?
- This guy , Gerald Redenbach .
he had a jeep and a golden retriever . He wore a scarf .
She found him so cool .
and you stretched out mom to him ?
so in kind .
how ?
I was always close to her and was cute and charming .
- That worked ?
- Do the pudding test .
- I don &apos;t like pudding .
- Forget the pudding .
the point is , you &apos;re young , Sam .
Relationships come and go .
She may have the friend this week and next week , who knows ?
do you understand ?
yes .
I keep myself available in case Miles leaves or dies .
or they separate friendly .
- Okay , that &apos;s how I do it .
- You should .
- I think that went well .
- Me too .
we are always talking about taking time for ourselves . I have done that .
I was at a dance class .
silly .
the teacher found I have talent .
really silly , but she said that .
and that &apos;s crazy , but afterwards we went to a bar , and I met a guy .
not as you think .
I am married .
you know Doug .
not really , he never comes . That &apos;s not his thing .
but whose thing is that ?
we don &apos;t come here for fun .
nothing against you .
I like you all .
Marjorie , you .
So , Sam ...
Sam is ... He had a good week .
but the thing is that , I was in the bar and probably for the first time since Sam &apos;s diagnosis I had no worries or anxiety .
I just had fun with these strangers who have nothing to do with autism .
and again , I like you .
but this guy , this bartender is so ....
his life is so crazy and daring and normal . Do you know ?
and I realized that the ...
Sam will never have such a life .
so ...
I don &apos;t know either , I ...
I made lemon slices , so grab calmly .
there is a little too much lemon in it .
your dad is right .
Girls are fair game until there is a wedding ring on their finger .
an engagement ring means she is ready for a mistake .
okay , that &apos;s perfect .
Take good care .
sometimes I wish I was as casual as Zahid .
of all I know , he is most successful with girls .
that &apos;s how you do it .
I hide , because the guy wants to kick my ass , and he has a tattoo on his neck .
- How are you doing ?
how is Doug ?
- Oh , we went out .
that was a total disaster .
always , when we have fun , I mess it up .
stop .
You do that super .
it is noble that you remain with him according to what he has done .
that was a long time ago .
how has Christopher been doing since he attended regular school ?
he makes steps backwards .
- He has tantrums .
- Have you tried music therapy ?
I met this woman last year at the autism run , and I think I still have her card .
She has a real studio .
She has something of a punk rocker , but she is cuddly .
and ...
- Oh no .
- What is ?
my credit card .
- Lock card .
- What is going on ?
I have to block the Visa @ card .
I forgot them after dancing in the bar .
- You want to wear the sweater ?
- What &apos;s wrong ?
nothing , I just don &apos;t understand why you do so much exercise when you don &apos;t see your great figure .
real ?
should I put on a slutter ?
- Why are you locking them ?
- Identity theft ?
that was a compliment .
you are wonderful under the monster .
Bye !
the bar is ten minutes away .
pick them up .
My To ’ -@ do ’ -@ list is already full enough .
we have everything debited automatically .
if we have to change that , ten more points will be added to the list .
- I get them .
it is on my way . - No .
you know what ?
it was my mistake .
- I &apos;m already doing that .
- Sure ?
I &apos;m sorry I was so snappy .
I don &apos;t hear it anymore .
Coach Briggs .
You wanted to speak to me ?
- Yes , come here .
sit down . - Okay .
we have to talk .
when it comes to my suspension , I &apos;m really sorry .
really , the team is very important to me .
I would never do anything that harms him .
Gardner , look at this office .
my life is not great .
do you know what makes me really happy , besides my brother &apos;s failure ?
these are girls who have talent , just like you .
Taking you in the selection was risky .
- I don &apos;t want to regret that .
- No .
if I can do something to make up for it ...
- How ... - There is something .
you beat the daughter of our greatest sponsor .
Her parents always charter the bus for the semi-finals .
excuse me ?
She apologized to Beth .
it &apos;s up to you .
your team will not be thrilled if there is no bus .
but don &apos;t worry .
Teens -@ girls always treat each other nicely and humanly .
I should not have beaten you , no matter how nasty you were , and I &apos;m sorry .
your eye looks better , almost normal .
you are shit in excuse .
yes , I know .
everything cool again ?
Listen , I know your brother has big problems .
there is certainly a lot of anger .
Get a stress ball .
I know you just apologize for getting the bus again .
from me .
you can have it .
but do not make big on the toilet .
Oh , and I heard you &apos;re with Evan Chapin .
that is fully courageous .
most would be afraid to get involved with him , you would not .
Bye .
- I need food money .
- I hate the slut .
Slut ?
do you think she is promiscuous ?
No , she just annoys .
don &apos;t take everything literally , you idiot .
come to me when no one eats with you .
okay .
the lessons begin .
you want to relax the woman ?
keep your GPS ready , I will take you to Vaginahausen .
- This is not a real place .
- Yes , and I am the mayor .
Step one : be megacharmant .
Julia , Roald Amundsen fed weak sled dogs to strong dogs during his expedition through the Antarctic so that it progressed faster .
- He made them cannibals .
what is your favorite food ?
Step two : find out what annoys her boyfriend .
but go ahead subtly .
Julia , what are Miles &apos; three biggest weaknesses ?
You can also name more than three .
and step three , the most important of all :
strawberries coated with chocolate .
makes girls sharp , and that is proven .
this would require empirical evidence .
for example , their panties on the floor of my kitchenette .
this is anecdotal and pseudo-scientific .
get the fucking berries .
cool shirt .
the Pharcyde .
I saw them live in 1996 .
I was the whitest guy in the audience .
They are certainly the whitest everywhere .
- In five minutes we are open .
- I just want to pick up a credit card .
the name is Elsa Gardner .
that sounds like I &apos;m an ass , but I can only give it to the owner .
Regulation .
do you make an exception for one who wants to score points with his wife ?
we were first screened .
it is not possible .
come .
I will call them .
let her confirm it .
I understand that .
Hey , Treasure .
what &apos;s there ?
I am in the bar to get your credit card .
tell the guy here .
Well , she tells you .
Hello , Nick here .
there is no one .
Hello ?
- So you don &apos;t help me ?
- Sorry , I can &apos;t .
Thank you very much .
Do you know why Evan flew from school ?
- Surely we do not know .
- But there are a lot of rumors .
it was said he sold the band Meth , so it &apos;s so bad .
I heard he slept with CourtneyBsMom , and Courtney A saw her .
I heard on Halloween he went as a wolf and tore a sheep .
- That is not true .
- Some eat disgusting stuff .
it must have been bad , he was arrested .
- Arrested ?
- Yes .
were you not knowing ?
- Casey is only in tithes .
- Yes , I forgot that .
the superstar is still a baby .
little baby .
in scientific discoveries , evidence is important .
Yo , Arlo .
but to really understand something , you have to ask questions .
Sorry .
I am the boy whose sister beat you .
you kissed Henry yesterday , and today you kiss Arlo .
I wanted to ask , how did he get you around ?
please be as specific as possible .
Age , what is it ?
Bailey is the perfect test person as she is a slut .
you research how to span women ?
- Awesome .
- Arlo , be nice .
- Do you want to lay a flat ?
- nailing ?
- I do not think so .
what are you doing ?
- No , he means Pussys .
I don &apos;t like cats .
I mean , cats are quite okay .
I prefer birds rather than cats . Especially the flightless birds are cool .
which girls are you into ?
or do you want to pop flightless birds ?
of course not .
a person , a human girl .
- That &apos;s enough , people .
They think I don &apos;t realize when they laugh at me , but I do .
I just don &apos;t always know why what makes it any worse .
just read it out .
we also keep it to ourselves .
can he cope with a girl like Bailey ?
trust me , man .
who is it ?
we keep it to ourselves , right ?
Let &apos;s go , say so .
- Tell us .
- Who is the lucky one ?
Let &apos;s go .
Man , leave him alone .
he is not quite together .
Adelie , Zügel- , Kaiser- , Eselspinguin .
Adelie , Zügel- , Kaiser- , Eselspinguin .
Sweetie ?
- Hey , is everything fine ?
- No .
I had to pick him up .
there was an incident .
he hasn &apos;t said a word yet .
he has locked himself in .
- No idea what &apos;s going on .
- We can do that .
Sam , may I come in ?
Honey , thank God .
are you fine ?
I want to talk to Dad .
really ?
clear .
for sure .
of course .
we understand each other lately .
you wanted that ?
yes , that &apos;s great .
very nice .
- Should I then ...
- Get your card in the bar .
and when you &apos;re back , we &apos;re either better off or we really need you .
- Call when you need me .
what happened at school ?
yes .
- Do you want to talk about it ?
now ?
I made , as you said , a plan to steal a woman .
those were not exactly my words .
I just researched , and these guys laughed at me and asked questions , I don &apos;t know what was so funny .
They have always laughed more , and then Bailey ...
I am completely together .
really .
I know that .
some kids are assholes , Sam .
that &apos;s just how it is .
but even the assholes get girlfriends .
all do themselves easily , only I do not .
that is not true .
Believe me , it &apos;s hard for everyone .
not for you .
you stretched out mom to the guy by jeep .
I probably presented this too simply .
when your mom got rid of the idiot , she let me flash ten times . okay ?
that &apos;s how it works .
but one must not give up .
so could I get a girl to like me ?
of course .
then I need chocolate coated strawberries .
Hey , Mr. Freigeist .
once again climbed up mountains ?
I am sorry .
I confused you .
I forgot my card here .
Elsa Gardner .
Gardner .
please .
yes , this is my card .
great .
yes , that &apos;s why I was here , so ...
Sorry .
is Nick there ?
- Is Nick there ?
- He must be somewhere here .
all right , you get out now and give the girl the strawberries .
then it is on the move .
you have done what you could .
get them to you .
yes , that &apos;s why we are here .
No , no .
No , Sam .
Sam .
No , Sam .
Sam .
- What are you doing ?
- What do you mean ?
it is illegal to enter through windows .
I couldn &apos;t ring .
She doesn &apos;t like it when you ring the bell because he could sleep .
one of their rules .
I like rules .
so things are clear .
before I do anything , I want to know all the rules .
her friend ?
which teenagers live together ?
Julia is not a teenager .
It is 26 years and three quarters .
Julia , your therapist ?
let us disappear .
come out .
go , we drive .
Let &apos;s go .
in the animal kingdom , attraction is a simple biological fact .
we have to get away .
only people make it complicated .
Wow , this is a great garden .
you could set up a pool .
Adjustable pools are cheap .
you can build a terrace around it , then it is almost like a real pool .
that &apos;s all I have to say about pools .
but ... Do you want to say something ?
okay .
why did you fly from school ?
what ?
that &apos;s you . Everyone tells something else .
what did you do ?
the car stolen by the director ?
- Made in laboratory coke ?
- No . - What happened then ?
- That doesn &apos;t matter .
is eternal .
- For me it plays a role .
- Why ?
I have enough trouble , and with you I could get it .
- Why don &apos;t you tell me ?
- It is stupid .
- Okay , go home .
- Come on .
I stole a tuba .
what ?
I stole a tuba .
and a trombone .
and then a few saxophones .
I broke into the rehearsal room and let go of some instruments .
I wanted to move them .
I had no good reason for it .
the rehearsal room was not completed .
that was the reason .
anyway , no matter .
90 minutes later the cops were with me and handcuffed me .
and since I stole the stuff from my own school , I flew out .
that &apos;s it .
that was it . I hope you are satisfied .
is that your seriousness ?
you have stolen musical instruments ?
- You did that ?
- I said yes , it is stupid .
- Why do you laugh ?
- Because this is for shooting .
because everyone thinks you are a crass daredevil .
- How did you drag them away ?
- With my hand cart .
that is getting better and better .
I don &apos;t realize that you &apos;re laughing at me .
I should not have said it .
- I have to pick up my sister .
- I did not want ...
- Evan , wait .
- What ?
I know .
I should go .
this is really unfavorable timing , but I ...
yes , you should .
- Yes .
go .
- Yes .
the arrow was pointed and sharp .
one should think that there are regulations that prohibit such things in public .
they are dangerous to the public , aren &apos;t they ?
absolute .
with you alcoholic people fire weapons through the area .
that &apos;s dangerous , isn &apos;t it ?
- Yes ?
- I don &apos;t arrive ... - What ?
- Well , your top is in the way .
of course .
then let &apos;s go .
okay .
I make wound ointment on it .
that has expired .
such a thing will not be bad .
yes , they only have so much space on these small tubes that they randomly print unnecessary information .
I have never met anyone like you .
and that &apos;s it .
you can dress .
we should exchange numbers .
if side effects occur from the expired ointment .
Listen to you should forget the matter with Julia .
why ?
on the one hand it is much older than you .
and when you tell her what you feel , it &apos;s a conflict of interest , and she can &apos;t be your therapist anymore .
- But I need her as a therapist .
then look for someone of your age .
a kind of exercise friend before I date Julia .
that &apos;s not how I would call it .
before Roald Amundsen crossed Antarctica , he made practice tours in simpler terrain .
this is only logical .
if I have enough experience with other girls , Julia becomes my girlfriend and is no longer my therapist .
or you could find a girl of your age .
that would be ideal for you .
and these girls will also like you .
that is good advice , thank you .
at any time .
Hey , Dad , will you tell Mom that with Julia ?
- Do you want that ?
- No , thank you .
well , then that remains among us .
I don &apos;t want to specify , but I had a really good day with Sam .
he is a good boy .
- What happened to your arm ?
- Nothing . That was a nail in the garage .
show him to me , then I beat him in .
- Did you do something ?
- Yes , wound ointment .
It had expired , but ...
the stuff doesn &apos;t really work .
it only loses effect .
what is it for ?
because I &apos;m such a good dad ?
- Yes , you are Superdad .
- Yes ? - Do I get a cape with the title ?
- Not now .
turn off the light .
human behavior is less like that of a chicken than that of an albatro .
no matter how far he flies , he always returns home .
except that he flies too close over the water and is eaten by a tiger shark .
