3 . Normal value
3.1 Determination of the normal value for all executing manufacturers without MWB
a ) Comparative country
35 . Pursuant to Article 2 ( 7 ) of the Basic Regulation , in the case of imports from countries without a market economy and , if companies cannot be granted an MWB , from countries referred to in Article 2 ( 7 ) ( b ) of the Basic Regulation , the normal value must be determined on the basis of the price or the calculated value in a comparative country .
( 36 ) In the announcement of the opening of proceedings , the Commission had proposed Turkey as an appropriate comparative country for determining the normal value for the People &amp; apos ; s Republic of China and invited the interested parties to comment on this .
( 37 ) Some interested parties objected to this proposal .
the main arguments they made against Turkey were :
- lack of competition on the Turkish domestic market ( there are only three manufacturers in Turkey ) ;
- production in Turkey corresponds to 1.3 % of Chinese production ;
- the cost structure of Chinese manufacturers differs from that of Turkish manufacturers in terms of labour and raw material costs ;
- the economic and cultural relations of the People &apos;s Republic of China and Turkey with the EU differ because Turkey is closer to Europe , has benefited from a customs union with the EU since 1995 and aligns its legislation with the EU in the light of the negotiations on Turkey &apos;s accession to the EU ;
- the Turkish currency lost much of its value ; some Turkish manufacturers are associated with applicants ;
- the quality of Turkish goods is too low .
( 38 ) The interested parties proposed India or Russia as suitable comparative countries .
( 39 ) The Commission sought to cooperate from other potential comparative countries such as Russia , India , Japan , South Korea , the United States of America , Serbia and Montenegro and South Africa .
Of the 38 companies around the world with which she contacted , only two agreed to work in the US .
( 40 ) The analysis of the available information showed that there is competition in the US @ American market for the affected goods with at least three manufacturers , around 30 suppliers , more than 15 importers and around 300 users .
According to the results of the investigation , as mentioned under recital 14 , the goods concerned and the Magnesia @ stones manufactured in the PRC or the USA and sold in the domestic markets were similar .
In addition , the study found that more than 50 % of the raw materials used by one of the US @ American manufacturers were imported from the People &apos;s Republic of China and that the manufacturing processes in the two countries did not differ significantly .
41 . This provisionally concludes that the United States of America was the most appropriate and acceptable comparative country within the meaning of Article 2 ( 7 ) of the Basic Regulation .
b ) Determination of normal value
42 . Pursuant to Article 2 ( 7 ) ( a ) of the Basic Regulation , the normal value for those exporting manufacturers to whom no MWB has been granted was determined on the basis of the manufacturer &apos;s verified information in the country of comparison .
Since the sales of the US @ American manufacturers were , according to the results of the investigation , trades in normal trade , the normal value for the types of goods comparable to the types of goods exported from the PRC to the Community was determined on the basis of the prices paid or paid on the US @ American domestic market .
( 43 ) The normal value was the weighted average domestic selling price charged by cooperating US @ American manufacturers to independent customers for product types with comparable MgO @ salary .
corrections may have been made for the different treatments of the different types of goods .
3.2 Determination of the normal value for the executing manufacturers to whom an MWB has been granted
( 44 ) It should be recalled that the dumping margin for companies granted an MWB was determined on the basis of their information on domestic sales and production costs for the goods concerned .
this data has been reviewed in the companies concerned .
( 45 ) In order to determine the normal value , the Commission first examined for each cooperating exporting manufacturer whether the total domestic sales of the goods concerned were representative compared to the total export sales to the Community .
In accordance with Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation , domestic sales were considered representative if the total quantity of these sales of each executing manufacturer corresponded to at least 5 % of the total volume of export sales of the manufacturer to the Community .
( 46 ) On this basis , it was established that the domestic sales of the goods concerned by an executive manufacturer were representative in the UZ .
the domestic sales of the goods concerned by the other executing manufacturer in the UZ were not representative .
( 47 ) For the exporting manufacturer with representative domestic sales , the Commission then identified the types of goods sold on the domestic market which were identical or directly comparable to the types sold for export to the Community .
48 . For any type sold on the domestic market which , according to the results of the investigation , was directly comparable to a type sold for export to the Community , it was examined whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative within the meaning of Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation .
the domestic sales of a certain type of goods were considered sufficiently representative if the total volume of domestic sales of this type in the UZ corresponded to 5 % or more of the total volume of export sales of the comparable type of goods to the Community .
( 49 ) This analysis showed that the executing manufacturer with overall representative sales did not sell all types of goods domestically in representative quantities .
( 50 ) Subsequently , the Commission examined whether the domestic sales of the individual types of goods sold in representative quantities on the domestic market could be regarded as transactions in normal trade , for which the share of profitable sales to independent customers was determined .
( 51 ) Domestic sales were considered profitable if the unit price of the respective product type corresponded at least to the production costs .
Therefore , the production costs for each type of goods sold in the UZ on the domestic market were determined .
( 52 ) As mentioned in recitals 50 and 51 , the share of profitable sales of the type of goods in question to independent customers on the domestic market was determined .
in cases where the sales quantity of a type sold at a net selling price in the amount of or above the calculated production costs corresponded to 80 % or more of the total sales quantity of that type and in which the weighted average price of the type in question corresponded at least to the production costs , the normal value was based on the actual domestic price determined as the weighted average of the prices of all domestic sales made in the UZ , regardless of whether these sales were profitable or not .
in cases where the volume of profitable sales of a type accounted for less than 80 % of the total sales volume of the type in question , or where the weighted average price of the type in question was below the production costs , the normal value was based on the actual domestic price , which was determined as a weighted average only of profitable sales , provided that the volume of these sales accounted for 10 % or more of the total sales volume of the type in question .
( 53 ) If the profitable sales amounted to less than 10 % of the total sales volume for one type , it was held that the sales volumes of this type were not sufficient to use the domestic price as an appropriate basis for determining the normal value .
( 54 ) The above analysis showed that certain types of goods were sold in normal trade .
( 55 ) For all types of goods which were either not sold in representative quantities or - due to the invoiced prices - not sold in normal trade ( see recitals 52 and 53 ) , the domestic prices of the executing manufacturer in question could not be used to determine the normal value , so that another method had to be used .
( 56 ) In cases where the domestic prices of a certain type sold by an executing manufacturer could not be used , the normal value had to be calculated on the basis of the costs of the manufacturer in question .
the normal value was calculated in accordance with Article 2 paragraph 3 of the Basic Regulation by adding a reasonable amount for the selling , administrative and overhead costs ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; VVG – @ costs &quot; ) and an appropriate profit margin to the production costs of the types carried out , if necessary .
To this end , the Commission examined whether the VVG ’ -@ costs and the profits made by the company domestically were reliable .
( 57 ) The actual VVG @ costs were considered reliable if the total volume of the company &amp; apos ; s domestic sales could be considered representative compared to the volume of export sales to the Community .
the domestic profit margin was determined by the domestic sales of the types sold in normal trade .
this was done using the method set out in recitals 45 , 48 , 52 and 53 .
for a company , the actual recorded VVG @ costs and profits could be used because it met the aforementioned criteria .
58 . For the other undertaking whose domestic sales were not representative , the normal value was determined in accordance with Article 2 ( 6 ) ( c ) of the Basic Regulation .
According to the results of the investigation , the cost structure of the other company with MWB and representative domestic sales for only a few types of goods showed such deviations that it did not provide a reasonable basis for determining the normal value .
However , according to the results of the investigation , the costs of the company whose domestic sales were not representative were reliable , so that the normal value was determined on the basis of the company &apos;s data corresponding to those of the other exporters / manufacturers of the same goods in that country of origin .
4 . Export prices
( 59 ) All export sales to the Community of exporters with MWB or IT were carried out either through related importers in the Community , related importers outside the Community or through companies that were not affiliated with the exporting manufacturers but worked closely with them or even had exclusive distribution rights .
in cases where exports were sold through affiliated companies , export prices were calculated in accordance with Article 2 ( 9 ) of the Basic Regulation .
in all cases where the exports of the goods concerned went to independent customers in the Community , the export price was calculated in accordance with Article 2 ( 8 ) of the basic regulation on the basis of the export prices actually paid or to be paid .
60 . Pursuant to Article 2 ( 9 ) of the Basic Regulation , corrections have been made for all costs incurred by the importer between import and resale , including VVG â – o@ costs and an appropriate profit margin .
In this case , the profit margin actually recorded by the cooperating independent introducers was regarded as a justifiable basis .
5 . Comparison
( 61 ) Normal value and export prices were compared at the level ex works and at the same trading level .
in the interest of a fair settlement , corrections were made on request in accordance with Article 2 ( 10 ) of the basic regulation for differences that demonstrably influenced prices and comparability of prices .
( 62 ) These corrections concerned differences in transport , insurance , provision , loading and ancillary costs , borrowing costs , commissions , import duties and customer service costs ( guarantee ) .
6 . Dumping span
6.1 Cooperating executive manufacturers to whom an MWB / IB has been granted
63 . In the case of the two undertakings to which an MWB has been granted , the weighted average normal value of the individual types of goods exported to the Community was compared with the weighted average export price of the corresponding type in accordance with Article 2 ( 11 ) of the Basic Regulation .
64 . In the case of the four undertakings to which an IB has been granted , the weighted average normal value of the individual types of the goods concerned exported to the Community for the country of comparison was compared with the weighted average export price of the corresponding type in accordance with Article 2 ( 11 ) of the Basic Regulation .
( 65 ) The provisional weighted average dumping margins , expressed as a percentage of cif @ prices free Community border , unpaid , reach the following values :
- Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 11,2 %
- Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 34.1 %
- Yingkou Guangyang Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 55,7 %
- Yingkou Kyushu Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 55,7 %
- Dashiqiao Sanqiang Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 99,9 %
- Yingkou Qinghua Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 41.4 % .
6.2 For all other executing manufacturers
( 66 ) In order to calculate the dumping margin for all other exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China , the Commission first determined the scope of cooperation .
to this end , it compared the total imports of the goods concerned originating in the PRC based on the Eurostat @ statistics based on the method set out in recital 81 with the responses of the cooperating exporters in the PRC to the questionnaire .
after that , the cooperation was low .
( 67 ) In view of the low level of cooperation , the dumping range for all other exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China was set at the highest dumping range determined for the cooperating exporting manufacturers , namely 99.9 % of the cif @ price free frontier of the Community , unpaid .
However , according to the results , the nationwide dumping range was higher than the residual damage range .
C. INCREASE
1 . Community production
( 68 ) In this investigation it was found that Magnesia @ stones were produced by :
- two applicant Community manufacturers and two other manufacturers who worked fully with the Commission during the investigation ( RHI , LWB , Refractarios Burceña S.L. and Ceramica del Nalon S.A. ) ;
- a manufacturer who answered the questionnaire in detail but spoke out against the procedure ( refratechnik ) ;
- seven other manufacturers and Assopiatrelle ( the Italian Fire Festival Association – @ Industry , which represents a production of 64,000 tonnes ) , which supported the Community industry but did not answer the questionnaire in detail .
another manufacturer sent a letter , but expressed neither agreement nor opposition .
2 . Definition of the Community industry
2.1 Manufacturers or manufacturers associated with the People &apos;s Republic of China who import the goods concerned from the People &apos;s Republic of China
( 69 ) The investigation showed that two of the cooperating manufacturers in the Community , namely RHI and Refratechnik , also imported the goods concerned from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
For this reason , it was examined whether these companies should be excluded from the Community sector in accordance with Article 4 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the basic regulation .
2.1.1 RHI
( 70 ) RHI produces in the community , but also introduces the affected goods from a related joint @ venture @ company in the People &apos;s Republic of China , RHI Liaoning .
it was found that in the UZ most of the Community sales of RHI were made in the community and only a small proportion came from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
this share is low , because the Chinese production of RHI is primarily intended for the rapidly growing Asian market .
RHI is also the largest manufacturer in the community , and its headquarters , R &amp; D @ center and largest production facilities are located in the community .
For this reason , it was found that RHI &apos;s core business with the goods concerned is located in the Community .
( 71 ) Subsequently , it was examined what effect the sale of the imported goods had on the total sales of the company in the Community .
the investigation showed that RHI had no significant profitability benefits from the resale of imports .
this resulted in a comparison of the profitability of the cooperating Community manufacturers .
( 72 ) Given the low proportion of imports and the fact that these imports did not have a significant positive impact on the profitability of Community sales as a whole , this undertaking was not immune from the negative effects of damaging dumping .
For this reason , it is considered that it would not be justified to exclude RHI from the Community sector .
2.1.2 Refratechnik
( 73 ) Refratechnik also produces the goods concerned in the Community and imports them from manufacturers in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
the investigation revealed that almost half of the company &apos;s joint sales in the People &apos;s Republic of China were manufactured in the UZ .
It was also noted that the expansion of business activity was largely made possible by an increase in imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
For this reason , it was held that the core business of Refratechnik is located not only in the community , but also in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
( 74 ) Subsequently , it was examined how the introduced sales affected the total sales of the Company in the Community .
the investigation revealed that refratechnik , unlike RHI , had a significant benefit from the resale of imports .
( 75 ) In view of the high proportion of imports in the total volume of sales in the Community and the fact that the core business appears to be gradually transferred to the People &apos;s Republic of China and refratechnik clearly benefited from the dumped imports , it was held that refratechnik should be excluded from the Community industry in accordance with Article 4 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the basic regulation and should be regarded as &quot; other market participants &quot; .
2.2 Community industry
76 . The production of the four Community manufacturers who worked fully on the investigation , including RHI and without refating technology , was 233732 tonnes during the period under investigation , representing 53 % of total Community production , thus forming the Community industry within the meaning of Articles 4 ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) ( 4 ) of the Basic Regulation .
( 77 ) The investigation revealed no self-consumption of the goods concerned for the Magnesia @ Stones producing industry .
some steel companies , on the other hand , produced Magnesia @ stones for their own consumption .
However , this amount was low compared to the production volumes of the refractory industry in the community .
Since this production is intended for self-consumption in the steel industry and none of the companies in the steel industry worked as manufacturers of magnesia @ stones ( although many of them received questionnaires ) , this part of the production does not seem to have any significant impact on the Community industry .
( 78 ) As the Community industry consisted of four undertakings and two of these undertakings accounted for around 2 % of the production volume , the following information for the Community industry was indexed for reasons of confidentiality .
3 . Community consumption
( 79 ) Consumption was determined on the basis of economic estimates transmitted by the Community industry according to customary practice .
The calculation of this data was based on steel production ( source : relevant reports from the International Iron and Steel Institute - IISI ) , divided by the average quantity of the goods concerned known to be required for the production of one tonne of steel .
( 80 ) The import quantities were determined on the basis of the Eurostat @ data for the relevant KN @ codes ( 68159100 , 68159910 , 68151010 , 68159990 , 69021000 and 69039020 ) .
of the determined quantities , deductions were made for those goods which , given their price , were clearly not the goods concerned .
the net volumes resulting after deduction ( for all countries combined 73291 tons and for the People &apos;s Republic of China 59831 tons ) were compared with the import volumes specified by the cooperating exporting manufacturers in the People &apos;s Republic of China ( about 42000 tons ) .
In view of the fact that some 13500 tonnes were imported from countries other than the People &apos;s Republic of China , ii according to the importers and users in the Community , the goods concerned were also imported by non-cooperating exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China and iii received but did not cooperate with many other executive manufacturers in the People &apos;s Republic of China , the view was held that the Eurostat @ statistics correctly record the import quantities .
In addition , a Chinese press release ( China Metallurgical News , 4 January 2004 ) reported that 80,000 tonnes were exported to Europe in 2003 , suggesting that the aforementioned Eurostat @ figure is by no means too high for the UZ ( 59831 ) .
( 81 ) Sales of the Community industry on the Community market were determined on the basis of the verified responses from the five cooperating Community manufacturers ( including refresh technology ) to the questionnaire .
the remaining quantities ( i.e. consumption less imports less sales of the Community sector ) were regarded as sales of non-cooperating Community manufacturers .
( 82 ) Consumption determined in this way , the development of which is shown in the following table , shows that the demand for the goods concerned in the Community was practically constant during the reference period .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003
Community consumption _ BAR _ 399563 _ BAR _ 397203 _ BAR _ 401499 _ BAR _ 400638 _ BAR _
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 99 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 100
4 . Imports from the country concerned to the Community
4.1 Market share of imports concerned
( 83 ) The quantities and market share of imports from the country concerned developed as follows :
Import sets _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
PR China _ BAR _ 23980 _ BAR _ 44542 _ BAR _ 54181 _ BAR _ 59831 _ BAR _
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 186 _ BAR _ 226 _ BAR _ 250 _ BAR _
Market share of imports _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
PR China _ BAR _ 6.0 % _ BAR _ 11.2 % _ BAR _ 13.5 % _ BAR _ 14.9 % _ BAR _
( 84 ) While the consumption of Magnesia @ stones remained constant during the reference period , imports from the country concerned increased by around 150 % over the same period .
As a result , the market share of the People &apos;s Republic of China increased from 6.0 % to 14.9 % to more than twice .
4.2 Prices of imports and price undercutting
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003
Prices of imports from the PRC ( Source : Eurostat ) _ BAR _ 686 _ BAR _ 601 _ BAR _ 560 _ BAR _ 533 _ BAR _
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 88 _ BAR _ 82 _ BAR _ 78 _ BAR
( 85 ) The table above shows the development of the average prices of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
prices fell by 22 % during the reference period .
( 86 ) The prices charged by the Community industry and the exporting manufacturers in the country concerned in the UZ on the Community market were compared .
prices were compared after deduction of all discounts and quantity discounts .
the prices of the Community industry were taken to the factory level , and import prices were based on the cif @ prices free frontier of the Community .
( 87 ) The comparison showed that imports of the goods concerned were sold in the Community UZ at prices below the prices of the Community sector ( expressed as a percentage of the prices of the Community sector ) .
In view of this undercut price range and the development of Community economic prices described above , it is clear that prices have already been significantly reduced .
5 . Situation of the Community industry
88 . Pursuant to Article 3 ( 5 ) of the Basic Regulation , the examination of the impact of dumped imports on the Community industry included an assessment of all economic factors and indices affecting the situation of the Community sector from 2001 ( base year ) to the UZ .
( 89 ) The following information on the Community industry is the aggregated data of the four cooperating Community manufacturers .
5.1 Production , production capacity and capacity utilization
( 90 ) Production , production capacity and capacity utilization developed as follows :
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ
Production ( in tonnes ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 88 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _ 91 _ BAR
Production capacity ( in tonnes ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 90 _ BAR _ 84 _ BAR _ 84 _ BAR _
Capacity utilization ( in % ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 106 _ BAR _ 108 _ BAR _
( 91 ) As the above table shows , production declined by 9 % in the reference period .
to save costs , production capacity was reduced by 16 % , resulting in an 8 % increase in capacity utilization .
5.2 Inventories
( 92 ) The following table shows the inventories for the annual financial statements .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003
Inventories ( in tonnes ) _ BAR _ _ BAR _ _ BAR _ _ BAR _ _ BAR _ _ BAR _
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 109 _ BAR _ 105 _ BAR _ 108 _ BAR _
( 93 ) Inventories increased by 8 % in the reference area .
the Community industry usually produces the goods concerned on order .
The level of inventories was therefore not found to be particularly meaningful for assessing the situation of the Community sector .
5.3 Sales , market shares , growth and average unit prices in the Community
( 94 ) The table below shows sales of the Community industry to independent customers in the Community .
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ
Sales quantity ( in tonnes ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 97 _ BAR _ 99 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _
Market share _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 97 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _
Average selling price ( EUR / ton ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _
( 95 ) The sales volumes and market share of the Community sector were constant during the reference period .
However , given the push for dumped imports into the Community market , this could only be achieved by reducing average selling prices by 11 % .
( 96 ) However , the 11 % decline in average prices does not reflect the decline in prices in key market segments sufficiently .
the goods concerned are mainly used in the steel industry for the lining of three types of vessels ( pans , converters and electric arc furnaces ) .
Initially , imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China consisted mainly of pans from the lower market segment .
in the reference period , however , there was a trend towards penetrating the higher segments of the converters and electric arc furnaces .
Converters and electric arc furnaces must achieve maximum useful life , which means that more expensive stones of high quality must be used to increase the number of furnace trips before renewal of the lining .
an analysis of the sales structure during the reference period showed that the Community industry was geared towards lower volumes for the high-quality market segments in order to defend itself against the pressure of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
this development shows that the average prices of some types of goods fell by more than 11 % .
for example , the average price of the largest product group ( stones with 9 % residual carbon and melting magnesia ) fell by 19 % during the reference period .
( 97 ) In view of the increase in imports , the Community industry did not grow despite a reduction in its average prices .
rather , he was forced to reduce production capacity and jobs .
5.4 Profitability
( 98 ) The profitability shown in the table below was calculated as a return on sales in the Community market .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003
Profitability of Community Sales _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 76 _ BAR _ 26 _ BAR _ 45 _ BAR _
( 99 ) Profitability declined significantly between 2001 and 2003 as a result of price reductions , which coincided with the increase in dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
in the UZ , profitability rose again slightly , primarily due to a cost reduction .
Although the Community industry made profits in the UZ , the profit margin was significantly lower than would normally be expected in the absence of dumped imports .
As the table shows , profitability was , as expected , much higher in 2001 , when the market share of dumped imports was still relatively low .
5.5 Return on investment ( RoI ) , cash flow , investments and capital raising opportunities
( 100 ) The table below provides an overview of the development of return on investment , cash flow and investments .
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ
Return on investment ( RoI ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 85 _ BAR _ 50 _ BAR _ 52 _ BAR _
Cash flow _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 81 _ BAR _ 55 _ BAR _ 60 _ BAR
Investment _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 75 _ BAR _ 131 _ BAR _ 134 _ BAR _
( 101 ) The table shows that the return on investment has largely developed in parallel with the return on sales ( see above ) .
Cash flow follows approximately the same trend , i.e. it declined from 2001 to 2003 and recovered slightly in the UZ .
the decline in return on investment and cash flow reflects the fact that average selling prices fell faster than the average cost of the goods sold .
( 102 ) The Community industry has increased its investment .
they were mainly used for the renewal of existing plants and machines , less for the construction of new production facilities .
( 103 ) However , the possibilities of the Community sector for raising capital from credit institutions or parent companies were not seriously affected during the reference period because companies belong to larger corporations .
capital raising opportunities are therefore primarily dependent on the strength of the Group and not necessarily on the circumstances in the business sector concerned .
this factor should therefore be irrelevant for this investigation .
5.6 Employment , productivity and wages
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ
Number of employees _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 91 _ BAR _ 92 _ BAR _ 93 _ BAR _
Productivity ( ton / workforce ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 96 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _
Wages _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 84 _ BAR _ 82 _ BAR _ 82 _ BAR _
( 104 ) As can be seen from the table , the Community industry reduced the number of its employees from 2001 to the UZ .
the increase between 2003 and the UZ can be explained by an increase in production .
Productivity was largely constant during the reference period .
( 105 ) Wages declined significantly in 2002 , but remained constant until the UZ .
The reason for this was a restructuring programme that year , as the development of production and employment shown above shows .
5.7 Amount of actual dumping margin
( 106 ) The dumping margins are listed in the section on dumping .
they are clearly above the threshold .
Moreover , the impact of the actual dumping range cannot be considered irrelevant given the volume and prices of dumped imports .
5.8 Effects of previous dumping or subsidy practices
( 107 ) The Community industry has not recovered from the effects of previous dumping or subsidy practices , as no relevant investigations have yet been carried out .
5.9 Conclusion on damage
( 108 ) While sales volumes and market share in the Community remained relatively constant , the Community industry was confronted with a 11 % decline in average prices during the reference period , although it changed its product -@ mix in favour of higher-value types of goods .
notwithstanding the cost savings , the profit margin decreased noticeably , so that the profits in the UZ were 55 % below the level of 2001 ; thus , the profit margin was significantly below the level that would have been expected without dumped imports .
( 109 ) The deterioration in the situation of the Community sector during the reference period is also reflected in the reduction in production and production capacity , the decline in wages , employment , return on investment and cash flow , and a lack of growth despite an 11 % reduction in average prices .
( 110 ) These negative developments fell at a time of relatively constant productivity , increasing investments and better capacity utilization .
the development of inventories and capital raising opportunities was not considered meaningful for the reasons set out above .
( 111 ) Taking into account all these indicators , the provisional conclusion is drawn that the Community industry in the UZ has been caused significant damage within the meaning of Article 3 of the basic regulation .
d . CITY URSAGE
1 . Preliminary note
( 112 ) It was also examined whether there was a causal link between the dumped imports from the PRC and the damage to the Community sector .
other known factors than dumped imports , which may have damaged the Community industry at the same time , were investigated to ensure that any damage caused by these other factors was not attributed to dumped imports .
2 . Effects of imports from the PRC
( 113 ) As has already been shown above , imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China rose by around 150 % and their market share by 118 % in the reference period .
as set out in recital 85 , imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China also fell by 22 % and a significant price undercut was noted ( cf . Recital 86 ) .
in response to imports , the Community industry maintained its sales volume ( not to jeopardise economies of scale ) , but had to significantly reduce its prices .
This price reduction led , among other things , to a 55 % decline in profitability .
thus , profitability is significantly lower than expected with this type of industry ; this level is no longer sustainable .
3 . Effects of imports from third countries
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ
Imports from countries other than China _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 90 _ BAR _ 140 _ BAR _ 141 _ BAR _
( 114 ) It is highly unlikely that imports originating in third countries such as the Republic of Korea and Brazil may have contributed to damaging the Community sector .
the market share of imports from countries other than the People &apos;s Republic of China was only around 3 % in the UZ .
Moreover , the average prices of imports from the Republic of Korea and Brazil ( i.e. third countries alongside the People &apos;s Republic of China , from which the largest quantities were imported ) were 25 % or 47 % higher than the prices of imports originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
Given the market share and the relatively high prices of imports from other third countries , it can be concluded that these imports can , if at all , have made only a minimal contribution to damaging the Community economy .
4 . Effects of competition between Community manufacturers and overcapacity
( 115 ) Some interested parties claimed that the Community industry had been forced to reduce its prices in competition to a damaging level due to overcapacity of the refractory industry .
However , the capacity utilization determined in the study for the reference period , the development of which is listed in indexed form under recital 90 , does not confirm this claim .
rather , it was comparable to the capacity utilization of the steel industry and other similar industries .
Although capacity was clearly reduced and prices fell , this was primarily a response to the increase in dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
the Commission also points out that a comprehensive restructuring of the Community &amp; apos ; s refractory industry took place as early as the late 1990s .
5 . Effects of developments in the steel industry
( 116 ) It was claimed that technical progress , which enabled the production of stones with a longer service life and efficient steel production , had caused damage to the Community sector .
During the investigation , several steel producers stated that their consumption of magnesia @ stones per tonne of steel produced had fallen as a result of technical progress .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003
Steel production EU – @ 25 ( kilotons ) _ BAR _ 180531 _ BAR _ 180758 _ BAR _ 183441 _ BAR _ 185197 _ BAR _
Consumption of Magnesia @ stones EU @ 25 ( in tonnes ) _ BAR _ 399563 _ BAR _ 397203 _ BAR _ 401499 _ BAR _ 400638 _ BAR _
Stone consumption in the steel industry ( tonnes per kiloton ) _ BAR _ 2,21 _ BAR _ 2,20 _ BAR _ 2,19 _ BAR _ 2,16 _ BAR _
this table shows that Magnesia @ stones account for only about 2 % of steel production .
a decline in this share would therefore not explain the decline in selling prices and profitability described in the section on damage .
For this reason , it is considered that the higher technical quality of the stones could not have been a major cause of damage to the Community sector .
( 117 ) The investigation revealed that some steel producers still produce a certain proportion of Magnesia @ stones themselves .
However , there are no signs that this practice would have been extended over time .
Moreover , since no steel company worked on the investigation as a manufacturer of Magnesia @ stones , it can be assumed that this production sector had no effect on the economic situation of the Community sector .
6 . Effects of exchange rate fluctuations
( 118 ) Another factor allegedly responsible for the damage was the change in the exchange rate of the dollar and the euro .
This could be relevant , as the Chinese renminbi has been pegged to the dollar for many years ; allegedly , the fluctuations in the exchange rate of the dollar and the euro have made exports to the community more attractive to Chinese manufacturers .
( 119 ) However , the dollar ’ s price loss against the euro did not always coincide with the rise in imports .
the decline in the dollar price began in June 2002 , while imports rose significantly as early as 2001 .
Moreover , the freight costs from the People &apos;s Republic of China to the Community increased considerably in the reference period .
If imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China had increased only because the exchange rate change had improved , a decline or at least a stabilisation of imports would have been expected as soon as the increased freight costs compensated for the exchange rate change .
although such compensation actually occurred ( freight costs increased by around 25 % in the last 15 months of the reference period according to P &amp; O Nedlloyd ) , imports continued to increase .
( 120 ) For this reason , it is provisionally concluded that the impact of the exchange rate changes can hardly have contributed to damaging the Community sector .
7 . Effects of Community imports into the Community
( 121 ) Some interested parties claimed that the damage was self-caused because the Community industry introduced the goods concerned from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
As stated above , imports from the PRC accounted for 5 % of its total Community market sales in the case of RHI , which is part of the Community industry .
the share and difference in the prices of these imports compared to Community sales are relatively small and may not have had a major impact on the market .
8 . Effects of Community exports
( 122 ) In the UZ , the Community industry accounted for around 27 % of its Community production .
export volumes decreased only marginally during this period .
However , the profitability of these exports was higher than that of Community sales , so it cannot be claimed that they have helped to damage the Community sector .
9 . Conclusion on the cause of damage
( 123 ) As already stated , the damage in this case was primarily in the form of price pressure , which caused a decline in profitability .
Taking into account the fact that the prices of rapidly increasing imports from the PRC were well below those of the Community sector , there is nothing to suggest that the factors mentioned above may have been a major cause of significant damage to the Community sector .
no other factors were found during the investigation that could have caused the significant damage .
( 124 ) On the basis of this analysis of the impact of all known factors on the situation of the Community sector , it is provisionally concluded that there is a causal link between the dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China and the significant damage to the Community sector .
E. COMMUNITY INTERESTS
1 . General considerations
( 125 ) It was examined whether there were compelling reasons for the conclusion that the introduction of anti-dumping duties on imports from the country concerned would run counter to the Community interest .
the Commission sent questionnaires to importers , industrial users and suppliers .
Answers were received by one of 14 users , five suppliers and three independent introducers .
( 126 ) On the basis of the information received by the cooperating parties , the following conclusions were drawn .
2 . Interest of the Community industry
( 127 ) It is well known that the Community industry includes four manufacturers employing around 800 people in the production and sale of the goods concerned .
it should also be recalled that the economic indicators for the Community sector examined above showed a deterioration in business results during the reference period .
Despite the slight improvement in the UZ , the Community industry was unable to achieve a satisfactory financial situation due to dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
( 128 ) It is clear that , in the event of a waiver of measures , more and more production facilities in the Community will be closed and that steel companies will be much more dependent on Chinese goods .
there are currently only a few production sites worldwide , and the majority of raw materials ( especially magnesium oxide ) are located in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
For this reason , there are no major sources of supply in other third countries .
As a result , the introduction of anti-dumping measures would be obviously beneficial to the Community industry .
( 129 ) For these reasons , it is provisionally concluded that the introduction of anti-dumping measures would be in the interests of the Community sector .
3 . Interest of independent importers
( 130 ) Four companies answered the questionnaire for independent importers , although only two of them imported the goods concerned into the UZ .
the cooperating importers opposed the introduction of measures and claimed that there were only a few major manufacturers of refractory products in the Community and that imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China stimulated competition on the Community market .
should measures be introduced and prices rise , Chinese companies may reduce their Community sales and importers would incur losses from reduced trade and profitability .
( 131 ) An importer argued that he might have to close his business with eight employees , since the goods concerned had a significant share of his business activities .
However , the aim of the anti-dumping measures is neither to prevent the import of the goods concerned nor to make the activities of importers in the Community more difficult .
Since the proposed measures concern only a relatively small part of the total cost of the Community steel industry and there are business relations between Chinese exporting manufacturers and Community users based on specific technical requirements , it is likely that the traditional business of importers will continue even if anti-dumping measures are introduced against dumped imports .
( 132 ) It was also noted that the introduction of measures would not have any significant consequences for the other importer , since the goods concerned have only a share of less than 1 % of the company &apos;s turnover .
4 . Interest of suppliers
( 133 ) The suppliers involved in the investigation supported the procedure .
two companies that supplied the community &apos;s industry with the most important raw material for Magnesia @ stones ( stillburnt magnesite ) claimed that they should have stopped supplying the refractory @ industry a few years ago , as first raw materials from the People &apos;s Republic of China and later also Magnesia @ stones from the People &apos;s Republic of China came onto the market .
5 . Interest of users
5.1 Prelude
( 134 ) 14 user companies , i.e. steel producers , answered the questionnaire and another manufacturer and the Steel Economic Association submitted opinions .
another user supported the Community industry &amp; apos ; s request , but all other steel companies opposed the introduction of anti-dumping measures .
Overall , user companies accounted for around 38 % of the joint consumption of Magnesia @ Steinen .
5.2 highly sensitive goods
( 135 ) Fireproof materials are of utmost strategic importance for the steel industry .
the entire steel passes through converters , ovens and pans walled out with Magnesia @ stones .
Supply difficulties could therefore have significant consequences in the form of production interruptions , repairs or safety problems .
for this reason , stones of high quality , i.e. long service life , and good technical support for this type of goods are very important .
due to the high technical requirements , a lot of time , high investments and research are required to establish a supplier relationship .
switching from a Chinese manufacturer to another manufacturer would also be very difficult .
steel producers claimed that they had made good progress with Chinese manufacturers and their Community importers over the last two years , mainly through improvements in efficiency and innovation .
( 136 ) Companies objecting to the introduction of measures therefore fear that there may be bottlenecks in the supply of high-quality stones and adequate technical assistance .
they fear that Chinese manufacturers would withdraw from the Community market if measures were introduced .
in addition , the largest deposits of magnesite , the most important raw material for Magnesia @ stones , are located in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
the steel industry is therefore afraid that its relations with Chinese raw material suppliers could deteriorate .
( 137 ) However , as stated above , the anti-dumping measures do not aim to prevent the import of the goods concerned or to make the activity of steel producers more difficult .
this means that non-harmful imports could be further imported into the Community .
Consequently , existing relations with Chinese exporters could be maintained even if anti-dumping measures were introduced against dumped imports .
This is also due to the fact that the goods concerned have only such an insignificant share of the total production costs of steel producers that measures would have only minor effects on the costs of users ( see recital 142 ) .
( 138 ) It should also be borne in mind that the goods concerned are of strategic importance to the steel industry .
in the event of a waiver of measures , there is a risk that the entire production of the goods concerned will be transferred to the People &apos;s Republic of China in the long term .
Given that there are no major manufacturers in other third countries , such dependence on Chinese imports is clearly not a viable scenario for the steel industry
( 139 ) Furthermore , there is no evidence that access to raw materials could be made more difficult for steel producers who produce Magnesia @ stones for their own use .
5.3 Market structure
( 140 ) The user industry claimed that the measures would strengthen a market structure with a few major manufacturers .
the users argued that this lack of competition was the result of mergers and acquisitions in the refractory industry in the 1990s .
( 141 ) The largest manufacturer in the Community had a market share of around 30 % in the UZ , which is unlikely to be sufficient to control and dominate the market .
this is underpinned by the fact that this market share declined as a result of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
as stated above , these imports will in all likelihood continue even after the introduction of measures .
moreover , many small businesses in the community and even some steel companies themselves produce Magnesia @ stones , and during the investigation no evidence was presented that the major manufacturers in the community dominated the market in the alleged way .
since no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour has been presented , the claim remains unfounded and unproven .
5.4 Higher costs
( 142 ) The steel industry also argued that anti-dumping duties on Magnesia @ stones would incur additional costs on the highly price-sensitive steel market and especially in competition with steel producers from third countries .
For this reason , anti-dumping duties would affect the competitiveness of the steel industry , especially since the pressure on the markets for other raw materials for steel products is also very strong .
( 143 ) Nevertheless , the answers of the user industry to the questionnaire show that the Magnesia @ stones account for well below 1 % of the total cost .
Consequently , the proposed anti-dumping duties would only have a marginal impact on the total cost of steel production .
the latest developments in the steel industry clearly show a recovery in selling prices and profitability , further reducing the share of Magnesia @ stones in total sales .
5.5 Conclusion on the interest of users
( 144 ) In view of the foregoing , it is unlikely that the anti-dumping measures on the Community market would conceal supply or affect competition , especially as the Chinese Magnesia @ stones are likely to continue to hold their market share .
the increase in costs would only be marginal and would not significantly affect the competitiveness of the steel industry .
for these reasons , it is provisionally held that the interests of users do not speak against the introduction of measures .
6 . Conclusion on the Community interest
( 145 ) The introduction of measures against imports of Magnesia @ stones originating in the country concerned would clearly be in the interests of the Community sector .
as far as importers / traders and user industries are concerned , any impact on the prices of the Magnesia @ stones should be minor .
By contrast , the market share and profitability losses of the Community sector and the decline in its prices are clearly larger .
( 146 ) In view of the foregoing , it is provisionally concluded that there are no compelling reasons against the introduction of anti-dumping duties on imports of Magnesia @ stones originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
F. ANTIDUMPINGMASSNAHMEN
1 . Damage reduction threshold
( 147 ) In view of the conclusions on dumping , damage and Community interest , measures should be introduced to prevent further damage to the Community sector by dumped imports .
( 148 ) Customs duties shall be set at a level sufficient to eliminate the damage caused by these imports without exceeding the identified dumping margin .
in determining the rate of duty required to eliminate the effects of damaging dumping , it was assumed that any measures should enable the Community industry to cover its production costs and achieve an overall adequate pre-tax profit , which could be achieved by a sector of this kind in the sector under normal conditions of competition , i.e. without dumped imports , when selling similar goods in the Community .
This calculation was based on profit margins before dumped imports based on a profit margin before tax of 8 % of sales .
on this basis , a non-damaging price of the similar commodity was determined for the Community industry .
the non-damaging price was determined on the basis of production costs plus the aforementioned profit margin of 8 % .
( 149 ) The necessary price increase was then determined by comparing the weighted average import price with the non-damaging price .
Import prices have been revised upwards by 10 % for three reasons .
Firstly , the production facilities of the Community sector were near the steel mills , while the cost of transporting from the port of import and the cost of insurance for imports was usually higher .
Secondly , the price charged by the Community industry to the respective steel mills during the sale also included technical support , which was usually not the case with the exporters .
Thirdly , all sales of the Community industry were at the level of end consumers , while many import business was at the level of traders who had additional costs .
( 150 ) Any differences resulting from the comparison were expressed as a percentage of the average cif @ import value .
the comparison was based on the groups of goods formed according to PCN -@ numbers ( see recital 11 ) .
( 151 ) The provisional weighted claims margins for companies granted either individual treatment or market economy status were :
- Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 17.1 %
- Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 42,1 %
- Yingkou Kyushu Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 21.9 %
- Yingkou Guangyang Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 21.9 % _ BAR
- Yingkou Qinghua Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 54.6 %
- Dashiqiao Sanqiang Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 66.1 % .
( 152 ) In connection with the calculation of the nationwide damage reduction threshold for all other exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China , it must be taken into account that cooperation was low .
For this reason , a range was calculated based on the data of those cooperating exporters who were not granted MWB or IB .
since this damage compensation threshold was lower than the highest damage margin in the case of the companies listed above , and in order not to reward non-cooperation , the nationwide damage margin was set at the level of the highest range determined above , i.e. 66.1 % .
2 . Provisional measures
( 153 ) On the basis of the foregoing , it was held that , in accordance with Article 7 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation , provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China should be introduced .
in accordance with the rule of the lower tariff , anti-dumping duties should be set at the level of the dumping or damage margin , depending on which of the two is lower .
Since cooperation was low , the residual range should be set in the amount of the highest for cooperating exporting manufacturers , i.e. in the amount of 66.1 % of the cif @ price free frontier of the Community , unpaid .
the company-specific anti-dumping duties set out in this Regulation were set on the basis of the findings of this investigation .
they thus reflect the situation of the companies during this investigation .
In contrast to the nationwide tariffs on &quot; all other companies &quot; , these tariffs therefore apply exclusively to imports of goods originating in the country concerned and manufactured by the named legal entities .
imported goods which manufacture other companies not having their name and address in the part of this decision , including those affiliated with the companies expressly mentioned , are not subject to these individual duties , but to the customs duty applicable to &quot; all other companies &quot; .

Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 557 / 2005
of 11 April 2005
to stop fishing for deep-sea shrimps by vessels flying the flag of a Member State other than Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and Poland
COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 2847 / 93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system for the common fisheries policy &#91; 1 &#93; , in particular Article 21 ( 3 ) thereof ,
Considering the following reasons :
( 1 ) Council Regulation ( EC ) No 27 / 2005 of 22 December 2004 fixing fishing opportunities and accompanying fishing conditions for certain fish stocks and stock groups in Community waters and for Community vessels in waters with fishing restrictions ( 2005 ) &#91; 2 &#93; stipulates quotas for deep-sea shrimps for 2005 .
( 2 ) In order to ensure compliance with the fishing restrictions on quota stocks , the Commission must set the date at which the allocated quota is deemed exhausted due to the catches of vessels flying the flag of a Member State .
3 . According to the information provided to the Commission , the deep-sea shrimp catches in the OPANO 31 area have reached the quota allocated for 2005 by vessels flying the flag of a Member State or registered in a Member State , with the exception of Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and Poland .
the Community has banned the fishing of this stock from 24 February 2005 .
it is therefore advisable to adopt this date -
has FOLLOWING REGULATION :
Article 1
due to deep-sea shrimp catches in the OPANO 3L area by vessels flying the flag of a Member State or registered in a Member State , with the exception of Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and Poland , the quota allocated to the Member States for 2005 is considered exhausted .
Fishing for deep-sea shrimps in the OPANO 3L area by vessels flying the flag of a Member State or registered in a Member State , with the exception of Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and Poland , as well as storage on board , reloading and landing of catches from that stock made by the vessels mentioned after the date of application of this Regulation are prohibited .

Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 558 / 2005
of 12 April 2005
amending Regulation ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 establishing a nomenclature of agricultural products for export refunds and Regulation ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 laying down specific implementing provisions for Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 804 / 68 with regard to export licences and export refunds in the milk and milk products sector
COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products &#91; 1 &#93; , and in particular Article 31 ( 14 ) thereof ,
Considering the following reasons :
( 1 ) Commission Regulation ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 &#91; 2 &#93; established the nomenclature of agricultural products for export refunds .
( 2 ) According to the reimbursement nomenclature , cheese shall be eligible for export refunds if they meet minimum requirements relating to dry milk mass and milk fat .
a type of cheese produced in certain new Member States could meet these requirements , but could not benefit from a refund because it does not fall under the current classification system of the export refund nomenclature .
Due to the importance of this cheese for the dairy industry , trade and the respective milk producers , it is appropriate to add a product code under the heading &quot; other cheeses &quot; so that the cheese can be included in the export refund nomenclature .
3 . The quantities for which export licences are applied for in the &apos; Cheese &apos; product category shall constantly exceed the profile of export restrictions applicable to the Community in accordance with the Convention on Agriculture concluded within the framework of the Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations .
the additional export licences requested under the newly created position will increase the pressure on this category .
4 . Pursuant to Article 3 of Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 &#91; 3 &#93; , no refund shall be granted for the export of cheese whose price is lower than EUR 230 per 100 kg before the application of the refund in the Member State of export .
However , this provision does not apply to cheese of code 0406 90 33 9919 of the nomenclature of export refunds .
In these circumstances , in view of the numerous applications for export licences for cheese , it is appropriate to apply this provision without exception to all types of cheese .
( 5 ) Pursuant to the footnote 10 in Annex I Sector 9 of Regulation ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 applicable to grated cheese , cheese in powder form and processed cheese , non-milk components shall not be taken into account when calculating the refund .
this determination is to be extended to all types of cheese and the relevant foreign milk components are to be described in more detail .
for the exporter and even more so for the competent authority , it can be very difficult or even impossible to determine the weight of these components .
therefore , it is advisable to reduce the refund by a standard amount .
( 6 ) The refund shall be granted for the net weight of the cheese .
in cases where the cheese is wrapped in paraffin , ash or wax or wrapped in plastic foil , there may be ambiguity .
it must be envisaged that such an enclosure is not part of the net weight of the product for the purpose of calculating the refund .
for plastic film , paraffin and ash , it can be impossible for the exporter and the competent authority to determine the weight of these materials .
therefore , it is advisable to reduce the refund by a standard amount .
( 7 ) Regulations ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 and ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 shall be amended accordingly .
( 8 ) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in line with the opinion of the Administrative Committee on Milk and Milk Products ;
has FOLLOWING REGULATION :
Article 1
Annex I to Regulation ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 shall be amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation .
Article 2
Article 3 ( 4 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 shall be deleted .
Article 3
this Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
it applies to export licences which will be applied for from 27 May 2005 .
this Regulation is binding in all its parts and applies directly in each Member State .
Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 559 / 2005
of 12 April 2005
to initiate an investigation into the alleged circumvention of anti-dumping measures introduced by Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2074 / 2004 on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People &amp; apos ; s Republic of China by imports of certain ring binder mechanisms sent from the Democratic People &amp; apos ; s Republic of Laos , whether or not registered as a source product of the Democratic People &amp; apos ; s Republic of Laos , and to record the latter imports in customs terms
COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 384 / 96 of 22 December 1995 on the protection against dumped imports from non-European Community countries &#91; 1 &#93; ( hereinafter referred to as the &quot; Basic Regulation &quot; ) , in particular Articles 13 ( 3 ) , 14 ( 3 ) and 14 ( 5 ) thereof ,
after consulting the Advisory Committee ,
Considering the following reasons :
A. ANTRAG
1 . The Commission received an application pursuant to Article 13 ( 3 ) of the Basic Regulation to examine the alleged circumvention of anti-dumping measures against imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China ( hereinafter referred to as the &quot; People &apos;s Republic of China &quot; ) .
( 2 ) The application was submitted on 28 February 2005 by Ring Alliance Ringbuchtechnik GmbH on behalf of joint manufacturers , which accounts for more than 70 % of the joint production of certain ring binder mechanisms .
B. WARE
( 3 ) The goods affected by the alleged circumvention are certain ring binder mechanisms normally assigned to the KN ’ -@ code ex83051000 , originating in the People ’ s Republic of China .
this KN – @ code is only provided for information purposes .
( 4 ) The goods which are the subject of the investigation are certain ring binder mechanisms sent from the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; examined goods &quot; ) and which are normally assigned to the same KN – @ code as the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
C. MONEY MEASURES
( 5 ) The measures currently in force and possibly adopted shall be a final anti-dumping duty introduced by Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2074 / 2004 &#91; 2 &#93; extending to imports of the same goods shipped from Vietnam &#91; 3 &#93; .
d . GREEN FOR SUPPORT
( 6 ) The application contains sufficient apparent evidence that the anti-dumping measures applicable to the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China are circumvented by reloading the examined goods in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos and / or their assembly in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos .
the following evidence was provided :
- According to the request , the trade structure has changed considerably due to a significant increase in imports of the goods examined , while imports of the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China declined after the introduction of measures for which there is otherwise no sufficient justification or justification other than the introduction of customs .
- This change in the trade structure seems to be due to the transfer of certain ring binder mechanics originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China to the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos and / or the assembly of certain ring binder mechanics in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos .
- In addition , the application contains sufficient evidence that the remedy effect of the anti-dumping measures applicable to the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China is undermined both in terms of quantity and prices .
It appears that significant quantities of imports of certain ring binder mechanisms from the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos have replaced the imports of the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
- In addition , there is sufficient evidence that the examined goods are sold at prices that have dumped compared to the normal value originally determined for certain ring binder mechanics originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
- Should other circumvention practices within the meaning of Article 13 of the Basic Regulation be established in the course of the investigation in addition to dispatch via the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos , the investigation may also extend to these practices .
E. PROCEDURE
7 . For the above reasons , the Commission has concluded that the evidence is sufficient to justify the opening of an investigation in accordance with Article 13 of the Basic Regulation and to cover customs imports from certain ring binder mechanisms sent from the Democratic People &amp; apos ; s Republic of Laos , irrespective of whether their origin is indicated in the application with the Democratic People &amp; apos ; s Republic of Laos , in accordance with Article 14 ( 5 ) of the Basic Regulation .
a ) Questionnaire
( 8 ) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation , the Commission shall send questionnaires to the exporters / manufacturers and their associations in the Democratic People &amp; apos ; s Republic of Laos , to the exporters / manufacturers and their associations in the People &amp; apos ; s Republic of China and to the importers and their Community associations involved in the investigation leading to the measures in force or mentioned in the application , as well as to the authorities of the People &amp; apos ; s Republic of China and the authorities in the Democratic People &amp; apos ; s Republic of Laos .
information may also be obtained from the Community industry .
9 . All interested parties should promptly and within the time limit laid down in Article 3 ask the Commission whether they are mentioned in the request and , where appropriate , request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3 ( 1 ) of this Regulation , since the time limit set in Article 3 ( 2 ) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties .
( 10 ) The authorities of the People &apos;s Republic of China and the authorities in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos shall be informed of the opening of the investigation and shall receive a copy of the application .
b ) Obtaining information and hearings
( 11 ) All interested parties shall be invited to present their position in writing on presentation of relevant evidence .
the Commission may also consult interested parties where requested by the parties in writing and demonstrate that there are specific reasons for their hearing .
c ) exemption from customs registration of imports or from measures
12 . As the alleged circumvention takes place outside the Community , manufacturers of the goods concerned may , in accordance with Article 13 ( 4 ) of the Basic Regulation which can prove that they are not connected with a manufacturer subject to the measures in force and for which it has been established that they are not involved in the circumvention practices within the meaning of Article 13 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation , be exempted from the customs registration of imports or from the measures .
Manufacturers wishing to obtain exemption should submit an application by appropriate evidence within the time limit set in Article 3 ( 3 ) .
F. CUSTOMS ADOPTION
13 . Pursuant to Article 14 ( 5 ) of the Basic Regulation , imports of the goods examined should be duty-amiced so that , in the case in which a circumvention is established during the investigation , anti-dumping duties may be levied retroactively from the time of customs registration on imports sent from the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos in the appropriate amount .
g . FRISTS
( 14 ) In the interest of proper administration , deadlines should be set within which
- interested parties can contact the Commission themselves , present their position in writing and provide answers to the questionnaire or other information to be taken into account in the investigation ;
- manufacturers in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos may request exemption from customs registration of imports or measures ;
- interested parties may submit a written request for consultation by the Commission .
( 15 ) It is pointed out that the exercise of most of the procedural rights enshrined in the Basic Regulation presupposes that the party concerned shall itself register within the time limit specified in Article 3 .
h . NOT WORK
16 . If an interested party refuses access to the necessary information or fails to provide it within the time limits set or significantly impedes the investigation , positive or negative findings may be made on the basis of the available information in accordance with Article 18 of the Basic Regulation .
17 . Where it is established that an interested party has provided untrue or misleading information , such information shall not be taken into account ; the available information may be used in accordance with Article 18 of the Basic Regulation .
If an interested party does not cooperate , or only in part , and the findings are therefore based on the available information in accordance with Article 18 of the basic regulation , this may lead to a result that is less favourable for that party than if it had worked with it -
has FOLLOWING REGULATION :
Article 1
Ring binder mechanisms within the meaning of this regulation are mechanics consisting of two rectangular steel rails or steel wires with at least four brackets made of steel wire attached to them and held together by means of a steel cover .
they can be opened either by pulling the half rings apart or with a small steel printing mechanism attached to the ring binder mechanism .
Article 2
Customs authorities are instructed under Article 13 ( 3 ) and Article 14 ( 5 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 384 / 96 to take appropriate steps to cover customs imports into the Community referred to in Article 1 of this Regulation .
Customs registration ends nine months after the entry into force of this Regulation .
the Commission may instruct customs authorities by regulation to cease customs registration of imports of goods into the Community produced by exporters who have requested exemption from customs registration and for whom it has been established that they do not circumvent anti-dumping duties .
Article 3
( 1 ) The questionnaires shall be requested from the Commission within 15 days of the publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union .
( 2 ) Unless otherwise specified , interested parties must contact the Commission within 40 days of publication of this announcement in the Official Journal of the European Union , state their position in writing and submit their replies to the questionnaire and other information if such information is to be taken into account in the investigation .
( 3 ) Manufacturers in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos who wish to apply for exemption from customs registration of imports or measures should submit an application by appropriate evidence within the same period of 40 days .
( 4 ) Within the same period of 40 days , interested parties may also submit an application for consultation by the Commission .
( 5 ) All relevant information , requests for consultation or requirements of a questionnaire as well as all requests for exemption from the customs registration of imports or from the measures shall be transmitted by the interested parties in writing ( not in electronic form , unless otherwise specified ) , stating name , address , e-mail address , telephone , fax and / or telex numbers .
all written opinions , including the information requested in this Regulation , responses to the questionnaire and all letters sent by interested parties on a confidential basis , must bear the note &quot; For limited use &quot; &#91; 4 &#93; and be transmitted in accordance with Article 19 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation together with a non-confidential version bearing the note &quot; For inspection by interested parties &quot; .

COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 3223 / 94 of 21 December 1994 implementing provisions on the import regime for fruit and vegetables &#91; 1 &#93; , and in particular Article 4 ( 1 ) thereof ,
Considering the following reasons :

Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 562 / 2005
of 5 April 2005
with implementing provisions of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 as regards mutual communications from Member States and the Commission in the milk and milk products sector
COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products &#91; 1 &#93; , and in particular Article 40 thereof ,
Considering the following reasons :
( 1 ) Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 1498 / 1999 of 8 July 1999 laying down implementing provisions for Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 804 / 68 as regards mutual communications from Member States and the Commission in the milk and milk products sector &#91; 2 &#93; has repeatedly been amended on essential points .
a number of amendments have been introduced to Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 and all regulations with implementing provisions .
For reasons of clarity , it is therefore advisable to repeal Regulation ( EC ) No 1498 / 1999 and replace it with a new regulation .
( 2 ) Regular communications on the functioning of the intervention measures provided for in Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 and , in particular , on the development of the stocks of the products concerned at intervention points or in private warehouses shall be essential for the assessment of production and the market in the milk and milk products sector .
3 . The fixing of aid for skimmed milk processed into casein and refunds is only possible on the basis of communications on the development of domestic and world market prices .
4 . Accurate and regular monitoring of trade flows , which may assess the impact of refunds , shall require information on exports of the products for which refunds are set , in particular as regards the quantities for which the surcharge is awarded under a tender .
( 5 ) In order to comply with the obligations arising from the Convention on Agriculture ( hereinafter : &apos; Convention on Agriculture &apos; ) concluded within the framework of the multilateral trade negotiations of the Uruguay @ Round , approved by Council Decision 94 / 800 / EC &#91; 3 &#93; , additional and more precise information on imports and exports , in particular on the application for licences and their use , is required .
rapid information on the development of exports is necessary for the best possible use .
under the same Convention , exports under food aid are not subject to the constraints imposed on subsidised exports .
Therefore , notifications of export licence applications must be distinguished as to whether these are notifications of licences requested for food aid deliveries .
( 6 ) Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 of 26 January 1999 laying down specific implementing provisions for Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 804 / 68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the milk and milk products sector &#91; 4 &#93; contains specific provisions for exports of certain milk products to Canada , the United States and the Dominican Republic .
therefore , the transmission of the relevant information must be provided .
( 7 ) Regulation ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 provides for a special scheme for the granting of refunds for components originating in the Community and used for the production of processed cheese in the context of active processing .
therefore , the transmission of the relevant information must be provided .
( 8 ) Pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 , in certain cases an export licence may also apply to a product code other than the code specified in field 16 of the export licence .

Council Regulation ( EC ) No 564 / 2005
of 8 April 2005
amending Regulation No 1601 / 2001 establishing a final anti-dumping duty and finally collecting the provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain iron or steel cables and ropes originating in the Czech Republic , Russia , Thailand and Turkey
the COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 384 / 96 of 22 December 1995 on the protection against dumped imports from non-European Community countries &#91; 1 &#93; ( hereinafter referred to as the &quot; Basic Regulation &quot; ) , and in particular Article 11 ( 3 ) thereof ,
on a proposal from the Commission after consultations in the Advisory Committee ,
Considering the following reasons :
A. PREPARATION PROCEDURE
( 1 ) On 5 May 2000 , the Commission opened an anti-dumping procedure &#91; 2 &#93; concerning imports of certain iron or steel cables and ropes originating in Turkey , among others .
( 2 ) This procedure ultimately led to the introduction of a final anti-dumping duty under Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 &#91; 3 &#93; in order to eliminate the harmful effects of dumping .
ANTRAG ON INTRODUCTION OF A INTERIMUM TRANSPORT
( 3 ) Has Çelik ve Halat Sanayi Ticaret A.S. ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; Has Çelik &quot; or &quot; Applicant &quot; ) , a Turkish executive manufacturer of certain cables and ropes made of iron or steel subject to current anti-dumping measures , submitted an application for a partial interim review of Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 .
4 . This request , in accordance with Article 11 ( 3 ) of the Basic Regulation , argued that the circumstances relating to dumping on the basis of which the measures in force were introduced had changed and that these changes were permanent .
( 5 ) According to the application , the applicant made structural changes that had a significant impact on the normal value .
In addition , the applicant argued that a comparison of the normal value based on his costs or domestic prices with export prices to the Community would result in a dumping range that would be significantly below the 17.8 % anti-dumping duty applicable to imports produced by him .
therefore , maintaining the current level of measures based on the previously determined dumping range is no longer necessary to compensate for dumping .
6 . Following consultations in the Consultative Committee , the Commission concluded that there was sufficient evidence to justify the opening of a partial interim review , so that it published a notice &#91; 4 &#93; and began an investigation which was limited to determining the existence of dumping with the applicant .
C. PROCEDURE
( 7 ) The Commission officially informed the exporting country representatives and the applicant of the initiation of the partial interim review and gave all parties directly concerned the opportunity to present their position in writing and request a hearing .
the Liaison Committee of the European Foundation of the Wire Rope Industries ( EWRIS ) submitted an opinion .
( 8 ) The Commission also sent the applicant a questionnaire which he answered within the time limit set in the notice .
( 9 ) The Commission obtained all the information deemed necessary for dumping , examined it and carried out a inspection visit to the applicant &amp; apos ; s operation .
( 10 ) The dumping investigation concerned the period from 1 July 2003 to 29 February 2004 ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; examination period &quot; ) .
WARE
affected goods
similar goods
( 12 ) Like the previous investigation , the review also showed that the SWR produced and sold or exported to the Community by the applicant in Turkey has the same basic material characteristics and uses , so that they are to be regarded as similar goods within the meaning of Article 1 ( 4 ) of the basic regulation .
E. DUMPING
Normal value
( 13 ) In determining the normal value , it was first examined whether the domestic sales of the similar goods made by the applicant were representative compared to its export sales to the Community .
this was the case because the quantities sold domestically complied with at least 5 % of its total export sales to the Community in accordance with Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation .
( 14 ) Subsequently , for each of the types sold by the applicant on the domestic market which , according to the results of the investigation , were directly comparable to the types exported to the Community , it was examined whether the domestic sales were sufficiently representative within the meaning of Article 2 ( 2 ) of the basic regulation .
this was considered to be the case if the total amount of domestic sales of a type during the period under investigation was at least 5 % of the total amount of export sales of the same type to the Community .
for most of the types exported to the Community during the period under investigation , a comparable type sold in representative quantities on the domestic market could be determined .
( 15 ) For the types of goods that reached the 5 % threshold , it was then examined in each case whether domestic sales could be regarded as transactions in normal trade by determining the share of profitable sales to independent customers .
in all cases , more than 80 % of the total domestic sales of the respective type were profitable , so that the normal value was based on the weighted average of all domestic sales during the period under investigation .
( 16 ) For the types exported to the Community for which , according to the results of the investigation , no comparable types were sold on the domestic market , the normal value referred to in Article 2 ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) of the Basic Regulation was calculated on the basis of the applicant &apos;s manufacturing costs for the types carried out in question plus an appropriate amount for selling , administrative and overheads ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; VVG @ Costs &quot; ) and for profits .
the VVG @ costs were based on those recorded by the applicant in domestic sales of the similar goods .
the profit margin was based on that which the applicant achieved in domestic sales of similar goods in normal trade .
Export price
( 17 ) Since all exports of the goods concerned were sold directly to independent customers in the Community , the export price was determined in accordance with Article 2 ( 8 ) of the basic regulation on the basis of the prices actually paid or to be paid .
Comparison
( 18 ) The comparison of the normal value with the export price took place at the level ex works and at the same trading level .
in the interest of a fair settlement , corrections were made on request in accordance with Article 2 ( 10 ) of the Basic Regulation for demonstrably price and comparability influencing differences in transport costs , insurance costs , provision , loading and ancillary costs , borrowing costs and commissions .
Dumping range
( 19 ) In accordance with Article 2 ( 11 ) of the Basic Regulation , the weighted average corrected normal value was compared with the weighted average net export price ex works of the comparable product type in order to determine the dumping range for each product type .
( 20 ) This comparison showed that there was no dumping .
F. DAUERHAFTE CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT
21 . Pursuant to Article 11 ( 3 ) of the Basic Regulation , it was also examined whether it could reasonably be assumed that circumstances had changed permanently .
( 22 ) In this respect , the investigation showed that the applicant made structural changes with a significant impact on production and organization , which resulted in significantly higher production efficiency and thus a decrease in production costs , so that the normal value was lower compared to that in the period under investigation of the previous study ( 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000 ) .
export prices rose over the same period , and the investigation showed no evidence that this increase was temporary .
( 23 ) It is therefore concluded that circumstances have changed permanently , in particular the rise in exports to the Community and the simultaneous decline in production costs .
g . ANTIDUMPINGMASSE
( 24 ) Since no dumping has been established , the measures vis-à-vis the applicant should be repealed .
( 25 ) Interested parties were informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which an amendment to Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 should be recommended and were given the opportunity to comment .
( 26 ) As a result , the EMRIS made some general comments , which mainly concerned rising commodity prices after the period under investigation .
the EMRIS did not question the above dumping findings , but expressed concern that the applicant might be able to practice dumping again .
( 27 ) With regard to raw material prices , it should be noted that although they may have risen after the period under investigation , this could not be taken into account in the dumping investigation for the applicant .
in the present case , the most important raw material is wire rod , a simple steel product whose prices usually fluctuate rapidly .
Therefore , an increase in the prices of such a raw material cannot be regarded as a permanent change that could invalidate the above findings .
( 28 ) Finally , it should be noted that the measures will only be repealed for the applicant and not for Turkey as a whole , so that , in accordance with Article 11 ( 6 ) of the basic regulation , the applicant will continue to be involved in the procedure and can be re-examined in the context of a subsequent review carried out for Turkey -

1 . Pursuant to Article 27 of Regulation ( EC ) No 1260 / 2001 , the difference between quotations or prices on the world market of the products referred to in Article 1 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Regulation and the prices of these products in the Community may be compensated by a refund on export .
2 . In accordance with Regulation ( EC ) No 1260 / 2001 , reimbursements for white sugar and raw sugar not denatured and in unchanged condition shall be fixed , taking into account the situation on the Community market and on the world sugar market , and in particular the prices and cost elements referred to in Article 28 of the Regulation .
according to the same article , the economic aspects of the intended export must also be taken into account .

amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 adopting commitments relating to the anti-dumping procedure concerning imports of potassium chloride originating in the Republic of Belarus , the Russian Federation and Ukraine
COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 384 / 96 of 22 December 1995 on the protection against dumped imports from non-European Community countries &#91; 1 &#93; ( hereinafter referred to as the &quot; Basic Regulation &quot; ) , in particular Article 8 thereof ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 992 / 2004 of 17 May 2004 amending Regulation ( EEC ) No 3068 / 92 establishing a final anti-dumping duty on imports of potassium chloride originating in Belarus , Russia and Ukraine &#91; 2 &#93; , in particular Article 1 thereof ,
after consultations in the Advisory Committee ,
Considering the following reasons :
( 1 ) The Council introduced Regulation ( EEC ) No 3068 / 92 &#91; 3 &#93; , a final anti-dumping duty on imports of potassium chloride originating in , inter alia , the Russian Federation ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; Russia &quot; ) .
by Regulation ( EC ) No 969 / 2000 &#91; 4 &#93; , the Council amended the measures originally introduced by Regulation ( EEC ) No 3068 / 92 on imports of potassium chloride originating in , inter alia , Russia and extended their validity .
( 2 ) In March 2004 , by means of a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union &#91; 5 &#93; , the Commission itself initiated a partial interim review of measures relating to imports of potassium chloride originating in , inter alia , Russia in order to examine whether the measures had to be changed to 25 Member States ( hereinafter referred to as &apos; enlargement &apos; ) as a result of the enlargement of the European Union .
( 3 ) According to the results of this partial interim review , a temporary adaptation of the existing measures was in the interests of the Community in order to prevent sudden and excessively negative effects on importers and users in the ten new Member States of the European Union ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; EU @ 10 &quot; ) immediately after enlargement .
( 4 ) With Regulation ( EC ) No 992 / 2004 , the Council authorised the Commission to adopt commitments meeting the conditions laid down in paragraphs 27 to 32 of that Regulation .
on this basis , the Commission adopted commitments from two exporting manufacturers in Russia in accordance with Article 8 , Article 11 ( 3 ) , Article 21 and Article 22 ( c ) of the basic regulation by Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 &#91; 6 &#93; .
( 5 ) In the case of an executive manufacturer , the Commission adopted a joint commitment offer for imports of potassium chloride produced by JSC Uralkali , Berezniki , Russia , and sold exclusively to the Community by Fertexim Ltd , Limassol , Cyprus .
( 6 ) JSC Uralkali informed the Commission that it would henceforth process its sales to the Community through another company called Uralkali Trading SA , Geneva , Switzerland .
therefore JSC Uralkali and Fertexim Ltd requested a corresponding amendment to Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 on the adoption of the joint commitment offer .
To this end , JSC Uralkali and Uralkali Trading SA have jointly submitted a revised commitment offer .
( 7 ) JSC Uralkali also pointed out that the obligation adopted by Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 did not allow direct sales of JSC Uralkali to independent customers in the Community .
In the revised commitment offer , JSC Uralkali also undertakes to comply with its conditions for direct sales to the Community .
( 8 ) The Commission examined the commitment offer .
it concluded that the revised commitment offer met all the conditions laid down in Regulation ( EC ) No 992 / 2004 , namely that i set the selling prices at a level that effectively contributes to the elimination of the damage , ii companies comply with certain import quantities for sales to customers in the EU and iii they also essentially retain their traditional sales patterns vis-à-vis individual customers in the EU .
Furthermore , it was concluded that , as claimed by JSC Uralkali , the transfer of Fertexim Ltd &apos;s distribution activities to Uralkali Trading SA did not affect the effectiveness of the obligation or , according to the information provided by the companies , their effective monitoring .
( 9 ) The JSC Uralkalis application for exemption of its direct sales to the Community from anti-dumping duties was considered acceptable as it complies with the usual procedure of adopting proper commitments from manufacturers directly exporting to the Community .
( 10 ) In the light of the foregoing , it was considered necessary to amend the part of Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 accordingly ,
has FOLLOWING REGULATION :
Article 1
Article 1 of Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 shall be replaced by the following :
&quot; Article 1

Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1258 / 1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy &#91; 1 &#93; , in particular Article 5 ( 3 ) and Article 7 ( 5 ) thereof ,
Considering the following reasons :
( 1 ) In accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 296 / 96 &#91; 2 &#93; , it shall be constantly informed at regular intervals of expenditure incurred by Member States .
to avoid unnecessary communications , it must be envisaged that this information must be transmitted monthly , without prejudice to the obligation of Member States to provide the Commission with information on a weekly basis in order to enable appropriate monitoring of expenditure development .
( 2 ) Certain information to be communicated by Member States should be transmitted electronically and digitally so that the Commission can use it directly for accounting .
nevertheless , in justified cases , transmission must remain possible in another way .
( 3 ) In order to simplify and streamline administrative procedures , the simultaneous transmission of a copy of this information in paper form should only be required for the monthly summaries .
( 4 ) In practice , the indication of certain quantities or areas in the detailed notification submitted by the Member States has little interest in granting the monthly advances .
this information should therefore be dispensed with .
( 5 ) The Commission &amp; apos ; s payments from the EAGGF Guarantee Section budget shall be made exclusively in euros .
Member States not participating in the euro , for their part , retain the choice between the euro and their national currency for payments to beneficiaries .
However , the paying agencies of these Member States , which make payments both in local currency and in euros , should be obliged to maintain separate accounts for the currencies used for payment .
in order to avoid a double conversion of payments , it is indicated that the possibility of reporting amounts paid in euros in local currency will be abolished .
6 . If , on the basis of Member States &amp; apos ; expenditure notifications , the sum of the commitments granted in anticipation , where appropriate , in accordance with Article 150 ( 3 ) of Council Regulation ( EC , Euratom ) No 1605 / 2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation for the general budget of the European Communities &#91; 3 &#93; exceeds half of the corresponding total budget for the current financial year , the Commission shall reduce these commitments .
in the interests of good budgetary management , this reduction should be proportionally distributed to all Member States on the basis of reported expenditure .
7 . If the Community budget has not yet been definitively established at the beginning of the financial year , payments may be made monthly per chapter up to one twelfth of the appropriations approved for the previous financial year in the relevant chapter in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 13 ( 2 ) of Regulation ( EC , Euratom ) No 1605 / 2002 .
In order to allocate the available funds fairly among the Member States , it is advisable to ensure that , in this case , the advances are granted in the amount of one percentage of the expenditure reported by the individual Member States per chapter and that the remaining amount not taken over in the respective month is allocated again in the Commission &amp; apos ; s decisions on subsequent monthly payments .
( 8 ) Within the framework of the CAP -@ reform and the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme , compliance by Member States with payment deadlines is essential for the proper application of the rules of budgetary discipline .
relevant provisions should therefore be laid down to prevent as much as possible from exceeding the annual resources available in the Community budget .
( 9 ) If there are delays in transmitting the documents relating to payments under Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 817 / 2004 of 29 April 2004 laying down implementing provisions for Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1257 / 1999 on the promotion of rural development by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund ( EAGGF ) &#91; 4 &#93; , it should be possible for the purpose of proper administration to postpone payments to a Member State for the month of September to the following month .
( 10 ) Expenditure on material measures in warehousing carried out in the month of September will be paid 50 % in October and the balance in November .
in order to simplify accounting by the paying agencies , it must be envisaged that 100 % of the expenditure on these material measures will be covered in October .
( 11 ) Rural development expenditure co-financed by the Community budget and national budgets shall be reported to the beneficiary no later than the second month after payment .
to unify the accounting rules in the area of the EAGGF Guarantee Section , it is advisable to ensure that these expenses are reported for the month in which the payment was made to the beneficiary .
( 12 ) Regulation ( EC ) No 296 / 96 shall therefore be amended accordingly .
( 13 ) The measures provided for in this Regulation shall comply with the opinion of the EAGGF @ Committee -
has FOLLOWING REGULATION :
