European PUBLIC REPORT ( EPAR )
YARVITAN
EPAR summary for the public
this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) assessed the documents submitted in order to arrive at recommendations regarding the use of veterinary medicinal products .
this document cannot replace the personal conversation with the veterinarian .
if you need more information about your pet &apos;s health or treatment , please contact your veterinarian .
For more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations , please refer to the scientific discussion ( which is also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Yarvitan ?
Yarvitan contains the medically effective ingredient mitratapid , which helps to reduce weight in dogs .
Yarvitan is a colorless to slightly yellow solution for input .
55 – @ ml or 120 – @ ml – @ bottles for dogs weighing up to 36 kg and a 210 – @ ml – @ bottle for dogs weighing up to 48 kg .
What is Yarvitan used for ?
Yarvitan is used in adult dogs that are overweight or obese ( obese ) to help lose weight .
it is used as part of a program that also includes a restriction on the dog &apos;s food intake .
the drug is administered to the dog for 3 weeks , followed by a 2 ° @ week break during which the veterinarian adapts the dog &apos;s diet to his energy needs .
then the dog receives the drug for another 3 weeks in addition to the adapted diet .
the required dose is calculated according to the weight of the dog , and the Yarvitan solution is administered to the animal with the feed .
how does Yarvitan work ?
the medically effective ingredient in yarvitan , mitratapid , acts in the intestine by blocking a protein ( the microsomal triglyceride – @ transfer protein ) .
this protein is usually involved in the absorption of fats from food .
by blocking the protein , Yarvitan reduces the absorption of fats from the intestine .
due to its effect , Yarvitan also has a slight appetite suppressing effect .
how was Yarvitan examined ?
Yarvitan was studied in dogs both in laboratory tests and in field studies .
two major field studies , one in Europe and one in the USA , were carried out on healthy dogs with a body weight that was 20 % higher than the recommended weight .
about three quarters received yarvitan , while the rest received the drug without the active substance ( control group ) .
the dogs received 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .
( 44 @ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @ 20 ) 74 18 84 47 E @ mail : mail @ emea.europa.eu http : / / www.emea.europa.eu © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged also other medicines such as vaccines , deworming tablets , anti-flea or anti-tick drugs , antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs .
Yarvitan reduced body weight in obese dogs compared to the control group in the recommended dose and using the 3 @ 2 @ 3 @ @ week treatment plan .
the weight-reducing effect was relatively moderate ( in the range of 6 ° -@ 7 % of the body weight before treatment ) .
Treatment is an initial measure within the framework of a programme to reduce obesity and must be combined with dietary changes that must be maintained even after the end of treatment .
what are the risks associated with Yarvitan ?
vomiting , diarrhea or soft chairs may occur during treatment .
These side effects are in most cases only slightly pronounced and subside without treatment .
even a reduced appetite may occur during treatment .
this is related to the effect of the preparation .
see the full list of side effects reported with Yarvitan in the package leaflet .
what precautions must be taken by people who administer the veterinary medicinal product or come into contact with the animal ?
this veterinary medicinal product has been specially developed for dogs and is not intended for use in humans .
IF the drug is taken accidentally , a doctor must be consulted immediately and the package leaflet or label must be presented .
in case of accidental eye contact , the eyes must be flushed out immediately with plenty of water .
Why was Yarvitan approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Yarvitan in treating overweight and obesity in dogs outweigh the risks and recommended granting approval for the placing on the market of Yarvitan .
the benefit -@ risk -@ ratio can be found in module 6 of this EPAR .
More information about Yarvitan :
on 14 / 11 / 2006 the European Commission granted Janssen Animal Health B.V.B.A. a marketing authorisation for Yarvitan throughout the European Union .

the veterinary medicinal product is to be administered once a day at a dosage of 0.63 mg mitratapid / kg body weight ( corresponding to 1 ml of the drug per 8 kg ) .
to ensure the correct dosage , the dog should be weighed on day 1 and day 35 ( i.e. at the beginning of each treatment period ) .
the veterinary medicinal product should be administered together with the feed .
use the dosing pipette supplied with the drug for administration .
during the first 21 days of treatment , the amount of feed of the animal may remain unchanged .
then the dog should be fed according to his maintenance needs ( this is to be calculated by the veterinarian ) .
this can be achieved either with normal animal feed or with a diet food ( with reduced calorie amount ) .
in clinical trials , the treated animals quickly increased again after the end of treatment if the diet was not restricted .
in order to avoid this rapid further weight gain ( rebound ) , restrictive feeding must be continued after maintenance needs after the end of treatment with the drug .
Therapy with mitratrapid should be limited to one treatment for a dog .
4.10 Overdose ( symptoms , emergency measures , antidotes ) , if necessary
After a 3 or 5 ° -@ overdose in dogs , the following symptoms were observed : soft or liquid stool , vomiting , salivation , anorexia , severe weight loss , emaciated appearance , dehydration and pale mucous membranes .
symptomatic therapy should be carried out in case of accidental overdose .
there is no specific antidote .

QA08 AB90
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Mitratapid is a strong inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride -@ transport protein ( MTP ) .
one assumes that
4 / 21 these effects are mediated by the MTP – @ inhibition at enterocyte level .
this leads to the blocking of lipid intake from food .
Mitratapid also has a slightly appetite-dampening effect , which is related to its mode of action .
due to the accumulation of triglycerides in the enterocytes , appetite may be reduced .
Mitratapid has no central effect .
in clinical trials , the following percentage weight loss values were obtained :

5.2 Information on pharmacokinetics
Laboratory animals and dogs quickly absorb orally administered mitratapid .
the most important metabolic conversion is sulfoxidation , which produces three active metabolites .
5 l / kg .
Mitratapid and its metabolites bind to plasma proteins to a very high degree ( &gt; 99 % ) and spread in the tissues .
the brain is not affected , which is why a central effect of the veterinary medicinal product can be ruled out .
excretion takes place quickly and predominantly via the feces .
8.5 hours ; the sulphon metabolite reaches 0.0092 µg / ml after 17.5 hours .
at the end of a three-week treatment period , mitratapid reaches average steady @ state -@ concentrations of 0.0068 µg / ml , the sulfoxide -@ metabolites of 0.0089 µg / ml or
the terminal plasma half-life is 6.3 hours for mitratapid , 9.8 hours or
the pharmacokinetic parameters show variable dose dependence , and vary slightly between the first and second three-week treatment periods of a complete treatment regimen .

European PUBLIC REPORT ( EPAR )
ZACTRAN
EPAR summary for the public
this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) came to the recommendations regarding the use of veterinary medicinal products on the basis of the assessment of the documents submitted .
this document cannot replace the personal conversation with the veterinarian .
if you need more information about your pet &apos;s health or treatment , please contact your veterinarian .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Zactran ?
Zactran is an injection solution for cattle containing the active ingredient gamithromycin ( 150 mg / ml ) .
What is Zactran used for ?
Zactran is an antibiotic .
it is used to treat and prevent respiratory diseases in cattle ( Bovine Respiratory Disease , BRD ) caused by the bacteria Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni .
before the use of Zactran to prevent FRG , the occurrence of the disease in the herd should have been proven .
Zactran is administered as a single subcutaneous injection ( injected under the skin ) .
the dose to be applied is calculated on the basis of the weight of the animal to be treated .
Animals weighing over 250 kg must be injected in more than one place .
how does Zactran work ?
the active ingredient of zactran , gamithromycin , is an antibiotic from the group of macrolides .
it works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes , i.e. the parts of the cells in which proteins are produced , thereby inhibiting the growth of the bacteria .
how was Zactran examined ?
Appropriate studies have been carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of Zactran in cattle .
the main clinical studies were conducted on farms in a number of countries in Europe and outside the EU .
the effect of zactran on the treatment of FRG has been investigated compared to another macrolide -@ antibiotic ( tulathromycin ) already approved in the EU in cattle .
the effect of Zactran on the prevention of FRG was investigated compared to a placebo ( sham drug ) on cattle on the same farm with

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. diseased animals had come into contact and were therefore likely to become ill as well .
what benefit has Zactran shown in these studies ?
it has been shown that Zactran was effective in the treatment and prevention of FRG caused by Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni .
Zactran has proved to be as effective for the treatment of FRG as tulathromycin .
what is the risk associated with Zactran ?
after the injection of Zactran , swelling occurs at the injection site in up to 45 % of the animals .
The animals may also show signs of mild pain for a day .
swelling generally recedes within 3 to 14 days , but can persist in some animals up to 35 days after treatment .
what precautions must be taken by people who administer the drug or come into contact with the animal ?
Persons with known hypersensitivity ( allergy ) to similar antibiotics ( from the group of macrolides ) should avoid contact with Zactran .
Zactran can cause eye or skin irritation .
therefore contact with skin or eyes should be avoided .
if Zactran comes into direct contact with the eyes , they should be rinsed out immediately with clear water .
in case of direct skin contact , the affected area should also be washed off immediately with clear water .
in case of accidental self-injection , a doctor should be consulted immediately and shown the package leaflet or label .
how long must man wait until the slaughter of the beast and with the consumption of meat ( waiting time ) ?
the animals may not be slaughtered until 64 days after the last administration of Zactran .
how long does it take to wait for the animal &apos;s milk to be used for human consumption ?
Since the safety of Zactran has not been studied in breeding animals , the drug may not be used in lactating cows or heifers whose milk is intended for human consumption .
it must also not be used for pregnant cows or heifers whose milk is intended for human consumption in the last two months before the date of birth .
Why was Zactran approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Zactran in the therapeutic and preventive treatment of respiratory diseases in beef ( FRG ) caused by Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni ( if the occurrence of the disease in the herd has been proven ) outweigh the risks and recommended granting approval for the placing on the market of Zactran .
the benefit -@ risk -@ ratio can be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

Pharmacological FEATURES
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Macrolide antibiotics , ATCvet – @ Code :
QJ01FA95
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Gamithromycin is an azalide from the group of semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotics , consisting of a 15 ° -@ C lactone ring with a distinctive alkylated nitrogen atom at position 7A .
this special chemical structure enables rapid absorption at physiological pH -@ value and the long duration of action in the target tissue lungs .
Macrolide antibiotics have both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects , as they interrupt bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the ribosomal 50S -@ subunit , thus preventing the prolongation of the peptide chain .
In -@ vitro – -@ data prove that gamithromycin acts bactericidal .
these pathogenic germs are most commonly involved in Germany .
the following MHK and MBK • -@ data come from representative samples of field disolates within different geographical regions of the EU .

three mechanisms are blamed for resistance to macrolide antibiotics , also known as MLSB – @ resistance , as it affects macrolide antibiotics , Lincosamides and streptogramines in the same way .
These include the change of the ribosomal binding site , the use of active efflux mechanisms and the production of inactivating enzymes .
5.2 Information on pharmacokinetics
Gamithromycin in a dosage of 6 mg / kg body weight is quickly absorbed into the neck of the cattle after a single subcutaneous injection .
maximum plasma concentrations are achieved after 30 to 60 minutes .
the plasma is more than 2 days .
in the lungs , maximum concentrations are achieved after less than 24 hours at a lungs -@ plasma -@ ratio of &gt; 264 .
4 / 18 In the -@ vitro -@ plasma protein -@ binding studies , an average concentration of the free active substance of 74 % is produced .
the excretion of the unchanged active substance is mainly biliary .

European PUBLIC REPORT ( EPAR )
ZUBRIN
EPAR summary for the public
this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) assesses the documents submitted in order to arrive at recommendations regarding the use of veterinary medicinal products .
this document cannot replace the personal conversation with the veterinarian .
if you need more information about the medical condition or treatment of your animal , please contact your veterinarian .
If you would like more information on the basis of the CVMP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( which is also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Zubrin ?
Zubrin is a lyophilisate for ingestion , i.e. a kind of tablet that quickly decays after contact with moisture , e.g. when placed on the dog &apos;s tongue .
Zubrin contains the effective ingredient tepoxalin .
What is Zubrin used for ?
Zubrin is used in dogs for inflammation and pain relief in acute and chronic diseases of the musculoskeletal system .
Zubrin is given to the dog once a day about 1 ° -@ 2 hours after feeding , until the animal is better again .
However , since side effects may occur , any treatment should be carried out for more than 1-2 weeks under regular veterinary control .
how does Zubrin work ?
Zubrin contains tepoxalin , which belongs to the drug class of so-called non-steroidal antiphlogistics ( NSAID ) .
Zubrin works by blocking the enzymes Cyclooxygenase and Cyclooxygenase .
if these enzymes are blocked , less prostaglandin is formed .
Since the prostaglandins are substances that trigger inflammation , tepoxalin reduces inflammation and swelling of muscles or joints and the associated pain .

Zubrin has been studied in laboratory animals and diseased dogs in various veterinary practices / clinics in the USA and a number of countries in Europe ( &quot; clinical trials &quot; ) .
In these clinical studies , the pet owners administered their dogs extra once a day at a dose of 10 mg per kg dog &apos;s body weight with or without food .
the best results were achieved when Zubrin was administered 1 - 2 hours after feeding .
However , since side effects may occur , any treatment should be carried out for more than 1-2 weeks under regular veterinary control .
Zubrin was just as effective as other drugs of the same class and led to a significant improvement in dogs with muscle or joint complaints .
what side effects does Zubrin have ?
the side effects of Zubrin are those that can also be observed in other NSAIDs , such as
Vomiting , soft feces or diarrhea , blood in the feces , reduced appetite and weariness .
Vomiting or diarrhea was observed in one in ten dogs .
occasionally there may be hair loss or redness .
if such adverse effects can be observed in your dog , you should not administer Zubrin further .
In addition , if your dog receives further medication , you should inform the veterinarian before starting treatment with Zubrin , as some drugs may affect each other in their effectiveness .
what precautions must be taken by people who administer the drug or who come into contact with the animal ?
Zubrin has a special dosage form ( lyophilisate ) , which quickly dissolves when in contact with moisture and can become slippery or sticky when held in the hand .
therefore , you should make sure that you administer the drug with dry hands .
IF the lyophilisate dissolves prematurely in the hand , wash your hands thoroughly .
Zubrin should be placed directly in the dog &apos;s mouth , and you should try to keep the dog &apos;s catch closed for a moment .
Zubrin must not be used in people .
IF someone accidentally takes some tablets , a doctor should be consulted immediately .
Why was Zubrin approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Zubrin in treating inflammation or pain in muscles or joints in dogs outweigh the risks and recommended granting authorisation to place Zubrin on the market .
the benefit -@ risk -@ ratio can be found in module 6 of this EPAR .
Page 2 / 3 © EMEA 2006 More information about Zubrin :
In March 2001 , the European Commission granted Zubrin a marketing authorisation throughout the European Union to S @ P Veterinary .
Information about the prescription status of this drug can be found on the label of the folding carton .

Pharmacological FEATURES
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
-@ steroidal antiphlogistics ATCvet -@ Code :
QM01AE92
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
tepoxalin is a double cyclooxygenase and 5 ° -@ lipoxygenase ° -@ inhibitor with anti-inflammatory effect .
oral administration of 10 mg tepoxalin / kg body weight leads to an inhibition of prostaglandin and leukotriene – @ synthesis .
5.2 Information on pharmacokinetics
2 hours ) .
After administration of a therapeutic dose of 10 mg / kg , the Cmax of tepoxalin in fed dogs was 1.08 ± 0.37 µg / ml ( low-fat feed ) and 1.19 ± 0.29 µg / ml ( high-fat feed ) .
the absorption of tepoxalin is favoured by administration to fed dogs .
tepoxalin is significantly converted into its acid metabolites .
the acid metabolite is a highly effective cyclooxygenase and prolongs the efficacy of the mother substance .
in dogs , the plasma concentrations of the acid metabolite are higher than those of the mother substance .
after multiple administration over a wide dose range , no accumulation of tepoxalin or its acid metabolite was detected .
tepoxalin and its metabolites are highly bound to proteins , i.e. over 98 % .
tepoxalin and its metabolites are excreted via the feces ( 99 % ) .
