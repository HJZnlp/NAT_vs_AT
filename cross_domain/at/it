Introduction
Anjuta is a versatile integrated development environment ( IDE ) for the GNOME @ desktop , providing a variety of advanced development methods such as project management , program wizards , an interactive debugger , the surface designer Glade , the API – -@ Help Devhelp , the memory – -@ Profiler Valgrind , the performance – -@ Profiler gprof , a class generator , a powerful source code editor , source code – -@ Browser and more .
in the following screenshot you will see some of what you will encounter in Anjuta .
Please report any problems you encounter when using Anjuta - this will help to improve the software as well as the Open @ Source @ community .
first steps with Anjuta
Menus and key combinations
at the top of the Anjuta @ main window is the menu bar , which allows almost the entire functionality of Anjuta to be reached through menu items . Actions have been assigned depending on the type . File operations , for example , can be found in the File – -@ menu .
Menu bar
Anjuta ’ -@ menu bar
File menu
Key combinations are available for many menu items . All key combinations are displayed next to the assigned menu item .
Change editor page : StrgAltBild ↑ ( forward ) and StrgAltBild ↓ ( backward ) . You can also switch pages by right-clicking on the tabs and selecting a file name from the pop-up menu ( this is useful if all tabs are not immediately visible ) . some working environments may have assigned these key combinations , in which case you need to occupy them differently ( not in Anjuta ) if you want to use them in Anjuta .
Context help : Shift F1 . move the input tag over the word ( e.g. a function name ) for which you want to call the API – -@ Help , and use this key combination . Context help only works when Devhelp is installed ; otherwise , the Context Help menu and the button on the toolbar are disabled . You can get Devhelp from the Devhelp – -@ website , and you will also need to install the associated Devhelp – @ books .
automatic completion : Ctr.Enter key . Position the input mark exactly behind an incomplete word and use this key combination . A list of possible completion is displayed on it . You can scroll through the list to search and select the desired supplement .
other key combinations : look for key combinations that are displayed to the right of menu entries .
Adjust keyboard shortcuts
Key combinations can be changed under Edit Settings in the Keyboard Shortcuts tab .
Main window
the main window contains several view windows , which can be rearranged by dragging their respective title bar .
The document window has only one document active at a time ( when files are open ) . All file commands affect the active document . You can switch to each opened document by clicking on the respective tab . You can also do the same by right-clicking on any tab and selecting the desired document from the pop-up window , which is especially useful when many files are open but not all associated file tabs are visible .
the project window contains the tree of the project files when a project is open , otherwise the project window is usually hidden . A double click on any object in the project window opens this file .
the file window contains a file tree . if no project is open , the file tree usually shows the top folder of the file system . However , this can be adjusted in the settings . When a project is opened , all files of the project are displayed in the window . A double click on a file opens it with the corresponding application , as it is specified in the GNOME MIME • -@ settings .
the symbol window shows a tree of the available symbols in the project , which is formed by processing the ctags .
there is also a search tab in the symbol window where you can search for symbols .
the message window displays all output ( both stdout and stderr ) when an external command is executed . The message window is usually hidden , but appears when external commands are executed , such as compiling a file or project , error analysis , search , and many other operations .
Messages in the default foreground color ( usually black ) are normal messages . Orange messages are warnings , and red ones represent errors . Warnings and error messages are linked : a double click on such a message opens the corresponding file in the respective line number .
For example , if you compile a file that contains errors , red messages will explain the problems and point to the error location .
the terminal window is a terminal – -@ emulator in which you can enter commands as in the GNOME – -@ terminal .
Meeting management
all settings , including window sizes and positions , are saved when Anjuta is terminated . Session management is still in development , so you should not terminate Anjuta with unsaved documents .
File operations
create a new file and insert text
create a new file
To create a new file , select File New in the menu bar , or click the New File button on the toolbar , and a new page will appear in the editor ( or a new window if the parent document ? ? ) . New documents will be named New File 1 , New File 2 , New File 3 , etc .
Save file
You should save new documents as soon as possible to avoid data loss as a result of crashes .
File -@ assistant
File Creation Wizard
the &quot; Open File &quot; dialog
a wizard can also be used to create a new file by selecting File New from the menu bar . The New File dialog opens , select the file type and enter the file name . The extension will be added automatically . You can add license information and a file header . In case of a C / C + + header file , you can also add a header template . Click OK to confirm the creation .
Anjuta occasionally creates new file windows during some operations . For example , some Subversion • -@ operations such as diff and log view new file windows and output the output there .
insert macros
You can use macros to quickly edit repetitive text passages .
the macro -@ plugin must be activated .
insert
there are two types of macros : Anjuta – @ macros and user – -@ macros ( they are displayed as &quot; My macros &quot; ) .
to insert a macro , position the input mark to the desired location . Select Edit Macro Macros .... A dialog will be opened . Select the desired macro from the list . The result of the macro • -@ implementation will be displayed in the window and a summary will be displayed in the dialog box . Select Paste . the implemented macro text will be inserted at the current position of the input mark .
Macro
the macro -@ dialog
another way to insert macros is to editMakrosMakro insert ... , and then press the desired macro – -@ key combination .
defining macros
In the Insert Macro window , select Add or select Add Macro ... and the Add / Edit window will open , select the name of the macro , select or define a category , and set a key combination . Then edit text relative to your macro . The _ BAR _ character indicates the position of the input mark after executing the macro . Click OK . the macro will be added to the list .
You can also delete a macro by selecting it from the list and clicking Remove it , which is of course only possible with user @ macros ( &quot; My Macros &quot; ) .
Add / edit macro
Add / Edit dialog
Similarly , you can edit and change a macro by selecting it from the list and selecting Edit .
macro -@ keywords
They can be included in macro @ definitions . Macro @ keywords begin and end with the character &quot; @ . &quot;
Keyword -@ macro
the keyword -@ macro
Available macro @ @ keywords are @ DATE _ TIME @ , @ DATE _ YMD @ , @ DATE _ Y @ , @ USER _ NAME @ , @ FILE _ NAME @ , @ FILE _ NAME _ UP @ , @ FILE _ NAME _ UP _ PREFIX @ , @ EMAIL @ , @ TABSIZE @ , @ INDENTSIZE @ , and @ USETABS @ .
open and save files
File opening dialog
open a file : to open an existing file , select File Open from the menu bar and click the Open button , or use the key combination StrgO . this opens the Open File dialog , enter the name of the file you want to open or select it , then click Open . To open multiple files at once , you can select several by holding down Ctrl ; then click Open . If you have changed your mind , you can press Cancel to close the dialog without opening a file .
Dialog to open multiple files
the dialog &quot; Open file &quot; in mode for several files
You can enable the Show Hidden Files setting in the pop-up window , which appears in the File Opening dialog after right-clicking . This setting makes hidden files ( their name starts with &quot; &quot; ) visible in the file list . Remove this setting so as not to display hidden files . The File Opening dialog also has a built-in type filter , select the corresponding file type filter in the dialog , and the file list is limited to files of the selected type .
Save as file
Save a file : to save a file , select Save from the menu bar and click the Save button on the toolbar , or press Ctrl . If the file is new , the Save As dialog opens , enter a file name and click Save to save the new file under the specified name .
automatically save a file
If automatic saving is activated , Anjuta does not automatically save new files . You must first save them yourself . the same applies to the Save All setting : Anjuta does not save new files as long as you have not yet saved them yourself .
Save a file under a different name : You can explicitly save a file under a new name by selecting Save File as from the menu bar . The Save File As dialog opens and asks for the new file name . Enter the name and click Save .
Overwrite file when saving
if you use Save As with an existing file , the original will not be deleted , it will remain unchanged since the last save . If a file with the new file name already exists , then a confirmation dialog will be displayed to ensure that you want to overwrite it . Clicking Yes will overwrite the file with the one you save .
close a file : select Close File from the menu bar to close a file , or click the Close button on the toolbar ( you can also close a file by clicking on the cross ( &quot; X &quot; ) in the File Name tab ) , so that the current file is closed . If the file is new or not saved , Anjuta will ask if the file should be saved before closing .
editing files
Anjuta has a number of features to help you edit source files , which describe how some of the interesting features are used .
Editor edges
the toolbar for labelling
Editor margins : Editor margins are located to the left of the editor and are used for some specific purposes . There are three editor margins available : the row number border , the marker edge and the edge for text folds . By default ( that is , at the first start of Anjuta ) , only the edge for text folds is visible .
The border for line numbers is the largest of all three margins ( and slightly darker than the others ) and specifies the line numbers of a document . The border for line numbers can be displayed or hidden via the menu item ViewEditor edge for line numbers . A left click on the border marks an entire line ( including the line break , if available ) .
The text folding edge may contain the folding tree . Clicking on nodes in the folding tree folds code – @ blocks . An underscore is displayed under a folded line to make it clear that a code – -@ block has been folded down below the line .
hidden marking edge
Editor edges in case of invisible marking edges
If the marker edge is not visible , Anjuta displays markings as the background color of a line . For example , if a marker of a breakpoint is set for a line and the marker edge is not visible , this line is displayed with a red background . Similarly , the background color will be deep blue or yellow for a bookmark and a line number marker . If you do not like this ( possibly in combination with the currently used theme ) , you can turn on the marker edge in the View Editor marker edge menu .
Processing aids
Editor with editing aids
Syntax highlighting
Anjuta can highlight the syntax of many different languages , usually automatically by detecting the file type based on the extension . If Anjuta cannot recognize a file type , then no syntax highlighting is used . You can explicitly force an emphasis mode by selecting the style in the View Editor highlight mode menu .
Anjuta uses a property file called $ prefix / share / anjuta / properties / anjuta.properties , which has the same format as a SciTE @ property file but does not use all properties . The style of each element for all languages is stored in the $ prefix / share / anjuta / properties / styles.properties file , which uses some ordinary properties set by Anjuta in the $ home / .config / anjuta / Scintilla / editor – -@ style.properties file .
Text folding
Anjuta can display code – @ folds for source files with languages structured in blocks ( such as C , C + + , Pascal , and Java ) . All code – @ blocks in source files can be folded in and out by clicking on the folding points in the border for code – @ folding the editor – -@ window ( usually a “ + / – ” icon or an up / down arrow ) .
Code – @ folding is especially useful when editing very large source files with thousands of lines . As soon as parts are folded down , a document seems to be smaller , and easy browsing and editing is possible .
Please note that code -@ folding and editing aids are only available in the Scintilla -@ editor .
automatic formatting of source code
Anjuta can automatically format C or C + + source files or headers • -@ files ( automatically indent ) . This allows a good overview of the source code , improves readability , reduces the likelihood of syntax errors and saves time .
You can search C and C + + source files and header files from tags in the files . a tag ( or icon ) refers to a named entity such as a function definition , structure , or macro .
Symbol • -@ browser
Anjuta automatically searches for tags in all source and header @ files of an open project . You can jump to any function definition , structure definition , class definition or other tags without opening the corresponding file beforehand . You also do not have to know in which file the tag was found .
Tag -@ matching
You do not have to worry about matching and updating the tag @ database . Anjuta does all this .
search and replace text in files
search
To search for a string or regular expression in the current file , select Edit Find or press Ctrl AltF , and the Find dialog will open .
Enter the string to search in the field and select whether it is a normal string or a regular expression . You can also set the search direction , case sensitive attention , and search range , and click Search to start the search .
When searching successfully , Anjuta jumps on the search hit or performs another action ( according to the search action you selected in the Search Target tab ) .
if you want to continue the search , click on the button Search again or press Ctrl . so the next search hit is visited ( Use Ctrl for the previous search hit ) .
Search text dialog
Press the Stop button to stop a long search .
Setting the search area
in the Search Target tab , specify the search area and the action to perform in case of search success .
You can set the maximum number of actions to perform .
Search Target dialog
You can choose which text to search for .
Selections for &quot; Search in &quot;
search in files
set Search in &quot; All project files . &quot;
enter the text to be searched in the Search Print tab and set the search settings , such as case sensitive or consider only complete words .
to search for text in multiple files , use the Search in field to enter file patterns . Set the search variables .
File search patterns
specify a search process
You can select which action to perform when searching successfully .
depending on the previous selection ( search in , search direction , etc . ) , some operations are not available .
Choices for the &quot; Search Target &quot; action
replace
search and replace is comparable to the text search , with the difference that you can also enter the replacement text in the Replace with text box , and you can also specify whether you want to be asked before each replacement ( &quot; Replace First Hits &quot; and &quot; Replace All Hits &quot; ) .
Select Replace to replace the match or Next to get to the next match .
Search settings
You can also save search options .
the object highlighted in red is the active one , the preselected object specifies search settings that are loaded when Anjuta is started .
Search Settings Dialog
printing a file
Print preview for a C @ file
Print preview
You can access the print preview with File Print Preview . The current file is mapped and a print preview is displayed . Source code highlighted in the editor is also highlighted similarly in the preview ( and in the printout ) .
Print settings
If you now want to print and are satisfied with the preview , select File Print or Print in the preview window , and the print dialog below will open , select the appropriate print settings and click Print to print the file .
You can also set portrait or landscape format , paper size , page orientation and paper type , do not forget to make the right settings for your printer , otherwise the printout may not be as expected .
Print dialog
Anjuta has a powerful project management plugin that can open most projects based on automake / autoconf , but it may fail in some unusually configured projects , but as long as the project uses automake / autoconf in a typical way , it should work .
create a project from a template
to create a new project , select the menu item FileNew Project ... to start the project @ wizard . Read the first page carefully .
select the type of application to create on the second page .
in the last step you should check the entered information . Click Quit to create the project .
once the project is created , you can test it and create or run it .
the import process only works if the existing project uses autoconf / automake or , to some extent , a makefile .
load and save projects
Loading projects
To open a project , select File Open .... Select the project file ( * .anjuta ) in the dialog and click OK .
if a project was recently opened , you can find it in the Last File menu , select the file name of the project from the list , and the project will open .
Storing projects
the project is automatically saved when closed because all changes are made directly in the project structure .
