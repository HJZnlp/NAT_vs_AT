3 . Normal value
3.1 Determination of the normal value for all executing manufacturers without MWB
a ) Comparcountry
35 . In suwith Article Article 2 7 7 7 of the Regulation Regulation , the normal value be imimimimimimimcountries countries a market market and and if if granted granted granted granted granted granted granted , referred to Article to to 2 2 ( ( ( b b of the the Regulation Regulation Regulation on the basis the price price price calculated calculated value in a comparative country .
( 36 ) In the announcement of the opening of the proceedings , the Commission proposed proposed Turkey as a appropriate comparative , to determine the normal value for the People People Republic of of and and invited the interested parties to an opinion on this respect .
( 37 ) Some interested parties objected to this proposal .
the main arguments they put against Turkey were :
- lack of competition on the Turkish domestic market ( there are only three manufacturers in Turkey ) ;
- production in Turkey corresponds to 1.3 % of Chinese production ;
- the cost structure of Chinese manufacturers differs from that of Turkish manufacturers , in in terms of labour and raw material costs ;
- the economic and cultural relations of the People &apos;s Republic of China and those of Turkey and the EU are because because Turkey closer closer to Europe , benefbenefbenefcustoms customs customs customs with EU 1995 1995 1995 1995 legislation legislation legislation in light light light of the negotiations negotiations Turkey Turkey accession accession accession to the accession to @ EU ;
- the Turkish currency lost a ply in value ; some Turkish manufacturers are associated with applicants ;
- the quality of the Turkish goods is too low .
( 38 ) The interested parties proposed India or Russia as suitable comparative countries .
( 39 ) The Commission sought to to operate other potential potential ative countries such as Russia , India , Japan , South Korea , the United States of America , Serbia and Montenegro and South Africa .
of the 38 companies around the world they contacted , only two companies in the US agreed to operate .
( 40 ) The analysis of the available information showed that there US 15 US market market market competition for the 300 with with at least manufacturers manufacturers , around 30 suppliers , more than 15 15 porters and around 300 users .
According to the results of the investigation , as mentioned under recital 14 , the affected goods and the nesnesnesstones stones stones manufactured produced produced manufactured manufactured Republic Republic Republic Republic Republic Republic the the and and and and markets domestic domestic markets were similar .
In addition , the study found that more than 50 % of the raw materials used by the the the --@ American manufacturers were introduced from the People Republic Republic of China China and that the manufacturing processes in differ differ differ in the differ countries .
41 41 ) This visionvisionally that that the United States States America was the most appropriate and acceptable country of comparison within the meaning of Article 2 ( 7 ) of the Basic Regulation .
b ) Determination of normal value
( 42 ) In accordance with Article 2 ( 7 7 ( a ) of the OrdOrdance ance the the value for those those manufacturers manufacturers who have not granted granted MWWWbeen been on the basis basis the verified fied verithe manufacturer in the comparof comparison .
As sales to to the -, sales sales of -----according were were normal normal normal normal normal normal normal the the of of goods comparable to the types of goods goods from the the Republic Republic Republic of of the was was determined determined the prices prices paid paid paid paid paid on US US @ American domestic market .
( 43 ) The normal value was the weighaverage average domestic price price by the operating operating operating US US @ American charged independent independent independent for types types with comparable comparable ggO -@ salary .
Cornecessary , corrections have been made for the different treatments of the different types of goods .
3.2 Determination of the normal value for the exuting manufacturers to whom an MWB has Wgranted
( 44 ) It should be remembered that the dumping range for the companies to which an granted WMWgranted has was determined on the basis of their information on domestic sales and the production costs for the goods concerned .
this data has been audited in the companies of the companies concerned .
( 45 ) In order to determine the normal value , the Commission examined examined for each operating operating operating manufacturer whether the total domestic sales of the goods concerned concerned representative representative to the total export sales to the Community .
In accordance with Article 2 ( 2 ) of the General Regulation , domestic sales were considered representative representative if total total of these these of each each manufacturer manufacturer compted to at least % % of total total of the manufacturer &apos;s export sales to the Community .
( 46 ) On this basis , it was found that the domestic sales of the affected goods of an executing manufacturer were representative in the UZ .
the domestic sales of the affected goods of the other executive manufacturer in the UZ were not representative .
( 47 ) For the exmanufacturer manufacturer representative representative domestic sales , the Commission then determined the types of goods sold on the domestic market , which were identical or directly comparable to the types sold for export to the Community .
( 48 ) For each type sold on the domestic market , , according to the results of the investigation investigation was directly comparable to a type sold for export to the Community , it examined examined whether domestic sales within the meaning representative Article Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation were sufficiently representative .
Domestic sales of a certain type of goods were considered sufficiently representative representative the total volume volume domestic sales of this type in the UUwas to 5 % or more of the total volume of export sales of the comparable type of goods to the Community .
( 49 ) This analysis showed that the executive manufacturer with total representative sales did not sell all domestic types of goods in representative quantities .
( 50 ) The Commission then examined whether the sales of of individual types of goods in in representative quantities on domestic domestic domestic could be seen transactions transactions in normal , , determinfying the share of profitable sales to independent customers .
( 51 ) Domestic sales were considered profitable if the unit price of the respective product product was at least the production costs .
For this reason , the production costs were for for type of goods sold in the domestic Z on the domestic market .
( 52 ) As mentioned under recals 50 and 51 , the share of profitable sales of the product of in question to independent customers to the domestic market domestic determined .
in cases where the sales quantity of a type sold at a net selling price in the amount of the calculated calculated determined determined determined above above correspon80 80 80 more more more the total total sales of that that and and in the the weighaverage average of the the in in was at least least the production production production , the the was was on the the domestic , , which was determined as weighweighaverage average the the prices of domestic domestic made in the UZ , , respective of whether these sales were profitable or not .
in cases where the volume of profitable sales of a type accounted for less than 80 % of the total sales of of the type , or or the weighaverage average average of the the in question was below production production , , the value was was on the the price , , was was as as weighweighaverage average only the profitable sales , provided that the volume of these sales accounfor 10 % or more of the total sales volume of the type in question .
( 53 ) If the profitable in a a less less less less than 10 % of the total total , , it was held that the sales volumes of this type were not sufficient to use the domestic price as an appropriate basis for determining the normal value .
( 54 ) The above analysis showed that certain types of goods were sold in normal trade .
( 55 ) For all types of goods that were either not sold in representative quantities or - due to invoinvoiced prices - not normal normal trade ( see recrecrec52 52 and 53 ) , domestic domestic prices of the execmanufacturer in question could not be used to determine the normal value , so that another method had to be used .
( 56 ) In cases where the domestic prices of a particular type sold by a executing manufacturer could not used used the normal value had had to be calculated on the basis of the costs of the manufacturer in question .
the normal value was calculated calculated accordance accordance Article Article 2 2 3 of of the Regulation Regulation adding adding adding an amount for the the administrative administrative overover( eineineineineineinreferred referred VVVV@ @ @ @ ) appropriate appropriate appropriate profit the the the the the the the the the the the the if out .
To this end , the Commission examined whether the VVG @ @ costs and the profits profits by the company the company were reliable .
( 57 ) The actual recorded VVV-costs were were reliable if if the volume volume of domestic company of the domestic concerned could be considered representative compared to the volume of export sales to the Community .
the domestic profit margin was determined on the basis of the domestic sales of the types sold in normal trade .
This was done on the basis of the method set out under recals 45 , 48 , 52 and 53 .
for a company , the actually recorded VVG --@ costs and profits could be used , because it met the aforementioned criteria .
58 ) For the other company whose domestic sales were representative representative representative the normal value was determined in accordance with Article 2 ( 6 ( of ) of the Basic Regulation .
According to the results of the investigation , the cost structure of the other company with MWB and representative domestic sales for such devitypes of only showed showed such deviations that it it not a a basis basis for determining the normal value .
However , the to of the company , whose domestic sales were the representative , were reliable representative representative representative the were reliable , so so the normal value was determined on the basis the the company data , which corresponded to those of the other exporters / manufacturers of the same goods in that country of origin .
4 . Export prices
( 59 ) All export sales to the community of extors with MWB or IT were either either through affiliated porters in the the , , ated porters outside outside community , or through companies that were not not with the the manufacturers manufacturers but worked closely with them or even even the exclusive distribution law .
in cases where exports were sold through affiliated , , export prices were calculated in accordance with Article 2 ( 9 ) of the Basic Regulation .
in all cases where the exports of the goods concerned went to independent customers in the Community , the export price was calculated in Article 2 2 ( 8 of the the Regulation was calculated on the basis of the export prices actually paid or paid or paid .
( 60 ) In suant Article 2 ( ( 9 of the the Regulation Regulation correccorrechave been made made for all costs urururthe the imbetween import import and ale ale , , the VVG --@ costs and a range profit margin .
in this case , the profit margin actually recorded by the cooperating independent introducporters was seen as a acceptable basis .
5 . Comparison
( 61 ) The normal value and export prices were compared at the ex ex level and at the same trading level .
in the interests of a fair comparison , corrections for differences have demonin accordance with the the ) , ) of of the the Regulation regulation , which demonstrably influenced the prices and comparability of prices .
( 62 ) These corrections concerned differences in transport , insurance , provision , loading and ancinciary costs , borrowing costs , commissions , import duties and customer service costs ( guarantee ) .

6.2 For all other executive manufacturers
( 66 ) To calculate the dumping range for all other exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China , the Commission first determined the scope of cooperation .
To this end , it compared the total imports of the goods concerned originating ating People People Republic Republic Republic Republic Republic the the EuroEuroEurothe the the the the method method method set in in recrec81 81 the the responof of EuroEuroat @ statistics to the method the method of out to the questionnaire .
after that , the cooperation was low .

However , according to the investigation , the nationwide dumping range was higher than the residual damage range .
C. Publications
1 . Joint production
( 68 ) In this investigation it was found that Magnesia -@ stones were made by :
- two Community Community manufacturers and two other manufacturers fully fully with the Commission during the investigation ( RHI , LWB , Refractarios Burceña S.L. and Ceramica del Nalon S.A. ) ;
- a manufacturer who answered the questionnaire in detail , but spoke out against the procedure ( refratechnik ) ;
- seven other manufacturers , well as Assopopiatrelrel( the Italian Italian of of of tory ( -@ @ , , represents represents a of 64000 tonnes ) , which supported the Community industry , but did not answer the questionnaire in detail .
another manufacturer sent a letter , but expressed neither agreed nor rejected .
2 . Community Community definition
2.1 Manufacturers or manufacturers associated to the People &apos;s Republic of China who introduce the affected goods from the People &apos;s Republic of China
( 69 ) The investigation revealed that two of the cooperating manufacturers in the community , namely RHI and Refratechnik , also introduced the affected goods from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
For this reason , it was examined whether these companies should be excluded from the Community industry in accordance with Article 4 ( 1 ( a ) of the Basic Regulation .
2.1.1 RHI
( 70 ) RHI produces in the community , but also introduces the affected goods by a joint Joint --@ Venture --@ company in the People &apos;s Republic of China , RHI Liaoning .
It was found that in the UZ , majority of the HI I RHI was produced in the community and and only a small proportion came from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
this share is low , because the Chinese production of RHI is primarily intended for the fast-growing Asian market .
RHI is also the largest manufacturer in the community , and its headquarters , the R &amp; &amp; D centre and the largest production facilities are located in the community .
for this reason , it was found that the core business of RHI with the goods concerned is located in the Community .
( 71 ) Subsequently , it was examined the sale of sale sale of the goods goods on the total sales of the company in the Community .
the investigation found that RHI had no significant profitability advantages from the resale of imports .
this resulted in a comparison of the profitability of the cooperating Community manufacturers .
( 72 ) Given the low share of imports and the fact that these imports had no significant significant positive impact on the profitability of Community sales as a whole , this company was not immune from the negative effects damaging dumping .
For this reason , the view is held that it would not be justified to exclude RHI from the Community industry .
2.1.2 Reftechnology
( 73 ) Refratechnik also produces the affected goods in the community and introduces them by manufacturers in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
the investigation revealed that almost half of the company &apos;s joint sales were manufactured in the URepublic of the People in Republic UZ .
It was also noted that the expansion of business activities was made made possible by an increase in imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
for this reason , the view was held that the core business of Refratechnik is located not only in the community , but also in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
( 74 ) It was then examined how the sales sales affected the Company &apos;s total sales in the Community .
the study showed that Refunto , HI , refHtechnology had a considerable benefit from the resale of imports .
( 75 ) In view of the high proportion of imports in the total of sales in in Community Community and the fact that the core business to to gradually gradually gradually to to the Republic Republic Republic Republic and and and Refrathad clearly clearly clearly from from umpumped ed ports , it was was that that refrefbe be be excluded Community Community Community Community accordance accordance with Article ( ( ) ) ) ) ) of the Regulation Regulation and should to be regarded as &apos; other market participants &apos; .

( 77 ) The investigation did not show any the consumption consumption the the concerned for the Magnesnesnesia @ StStone manufacturing industry .
some steel companies , on the other hand , produced Magnesia --@ stones for own consumption .
However , this quantity was low compared to the production volumes of the the tory tory – -@ industry in the community .
as this production is intended for self-consumption in the steel industry and none of the companies companies the steel industry worked as a a of magnesnesia stones stones stones ( although many of them received questionn) ) , this part of production production to to have a significant impact on the Community industry .
( 78 ) As the Community industry consisted of four companies and two of these these accounted for 2 2 % of the production production , the following information for the dexed xed the Community xed for reasons of confidentiality .
3 . Community consumption
( 79 ) Consumption was determined on the basis of estimates of the economy economy by by the Community Community according to usual practice .
The calculation of these data was based on the basis of steel production ( source : relevant reports reports Iron Iron Iron Iron Steel Institute Institute IISISI , , by the the amount of the of of of the goods required for the production of a ton of steel .
( 80 ) The import quantities were determined on the EurostEurost@ @ for relevant relevant relevant N N @ codes ( 68159100 , 68159910 , 68151010 , 68159990 , 69021000 and 69039020 ) .
of the quantities determined , deductions were made for those goods goods , , in their their price , were not not the affected goods .
the net volumes resulting after duction ( 7329291 for for all countries and 59898tonnes tonnes for the Republic 98Republic ) ) were compared with the import volumes ( ( 442000 ) ) by the operating operating operating Republic China China the the Republic Republic of China .
In view of the fact that i 13500 500 500 were from from other other than the People Republic Republic of of , ii ii to to the imand and in in the , the the goods goods were also also by non-non-non-in in in People People Republic Republic Republic of and and iiother other other manufacturers manufacturers in the the of of of of questionaire aire aire but but did cocooperate co, was was that EuroEuroEurostat at @ @ statistics correctly the import import volumes .
In addition , a Chinese press release ( China Metallurgical News , January 4 , 2004 ) reported that 8000 tonnes were were ported ported Europe Europe 2003 2003 , ating that the the forementioned ststst@ @ number is no no way too high for the UZ ( 59831 ) .
( 81 ) Sales of the Community industry on the Community market were identified on the basis of the verified responses of the five coCommunity Community manufacturers ( including refsing manufacturers ) on the fracnaire .
The remaining quantities ( i.e. consumption less imports less Community Community sales ) were seen as sales of non-cooperating Community manufacturers .
( 82 ) The consumption determined in this way , the development of which is shown in the following table , shows that the demand for the commodity concerned in the Community was practically constant during the reference period .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _

4 . Imports from the country concerned to the Community
4.1 Market share of the imports concerned
( 83 ) The quantities and market share of imports from the country concerned developed as follows :
Import quantities _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
VR China _ BAR _ 23980 _ BAR _ 44542 _ BAR _ 54181 _ BAR _ 59831 _ BAR _
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 186 _ BAR _ 226 _ BAR _ 250 _ BAR _
Market share of imports _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
VR China _ BAR _ 6,0 % _ BAR _ 11,2 % _ BAR _ 13,5 % _ BAR _ 14,9 % _ BAR _
( 84 ) While the consumption of magnesia @ stones remained constant during the reference period , imports from the country concerned increased by around 150 % during the same period .
The market share of the People &apos;s Republic of China increased from 6.0 % to 14.9 % to 14.than twice in the reference period .
4.2 Imports and price prices

Prices of imports from China ( Source : Eurostat ) _ BAR _ 686 _ BAR _ 601 _ BAR _ 560 _ BAR _ 533 _ BAR _
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 88 _ BAR _ 82 _ BAR _ 78 _ BAR _
( 85 ) The above table shows the development of the average prices of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
Prices fell by 22 % during the reference period .
( 86 ) The prices charged by the Community Community and and the manufacturers manufacturers in the country country in the UZ on the Community market were compared .
prices were compared after deduction of all discounts and quantity discounts .
the prices of the Community industry were put to the level and and import prices prices prices based on the the free free free free Community prices .
( 87 ) The comparison showed that imports of the goods goods concerned in the Uthe were sold in the Community at prices were 16.6 % below the prices of the Community industry ( expressed as a percentage of the prices of the Community industry ) .
In view of this price price and and the described described of the prices of the Community described , it it clear that prices prices already been been depressed .
5 . Community situation
( 88 ) In accordance with Article 3 ( 5 ) of the Basic Regulation , the examination of the effects of dumped imports on the Community industry included an assessment of all economic factors and indices affecting the situation of the Community industry from 2001 ( base year ) to the UZ .
( 89 ) The following information on the Community industry is the aggregated data of the four cooperating Community manufacturers .
5.1 Production , production capacity and capacity utilization
( 90 ) Production , production capacity and capacity utilization developed as follows :
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Production ( in tonnes ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 88 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _ 91 _ BAR _
Production capacity ( in tons ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 90 _ BAR _ 84 _ BAR _ 84 _ BAR _
Capacity utilization ( in % ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 106 _ BAR _ 108 _ BAR _
( 91 ) As the above table shows , production decreased by 9 % in the subscription period .
to save costs , production capacity was reduced by 16 % , resulting in an 8 % increase in capacity utilization .
5.2
( 92 ) The table below shows inventories for the annual financial statements .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Inventories ( in tons ) _ BAR _ _ BAR _ _ BAR _ _ BAR _ _ BAR _
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 109 _ BAR _ 105 _ BAR _ 108 _ BAR _
( 93 ) Inventories increased by reference % in the reference room .
the Community industry usually produces the goods goods on order .
The amount of stocks was therefore not found particularly particularly ful for assessing the situation of the Community industry .
5.3 Sales volumes , market shares , growth and average unit prices in the Community
( 94 ) The table below shows sales of the Community industry to independent customers in the Community .
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Sales quantity ( in tons ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 97 _ BAR _ 99 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _
Market share _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 97 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _
average selling price ( EUR / ton ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _
( 95 ) The sales volumes and market share of the Community industry were constant during the subscription period .
However , given the push of of dumped imports to the Community market , this could only be achieved by reducing average selling prices by 11 % .
( 96 ) However , the 11 % average in average prices does not significantly reflect the decline in prices in key market segments .
the affected goods are mainly used in the steel industry to wall three types of vessels ( pans , converters and electric arc furnaces ) .
Initially , imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China consisted mainly of pan stones in the lower market segment .
during the reference period , however , there was a trend towards the penetration of the higher segments of the converters and electric arc furnaces .
Converters and electric arc furnaces must achieve a maximum service life , which means more expensive stones stones quality stones must be be to increase the number of furnace ace before renewrenewof the wall .
an analysis of the sales structure during the reference period showed that the Community industry was was towards lower quantities for the high-quality segments segments segments order to ose the pressure from imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
this development shows that the average prices of some types of goods decased by more than 11 % .
for example , the average price of the largest product of ( stones stones with 9 % residual carbon and melting magnesia ) fell by 19 % during the reference period .
( 97 ) In view of the increase in imports , the Community industry did not growth despite a reduction in its average prices .
Rather , he was forced to reduce production capacity and jobs .
5.4 Profitability
( 98 ) The profitability shown in the table below was calculated as a return on sales of sales on the Community market .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Profitability of community sales _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 76 _ BAR _ 26 _ BAR _ 45 _ BAR _
( 99 ) Profitability declined significantly between 2001 and 2003 as a result of price reductions , coincidue to the increase in dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
in the UZ , profitability rose slightly slightly , primarily due to a cost reduction .
Although the Community industry in the UZ made profits , the profit profit margin significantly lower than would normally be expected expected in of of expected in the absence of dumped imports .
As the table shows , profitability in 2001 , when the market share of dumped imports was still relatively im, was relatively higher as expected .
5.5 Return on capital ( RoI ) , cash flow , investments and capital raising opportunities
( 100 ) The table below provides an overview of the development of return on capital , cash flow and investments .
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Return on capital ( RoI ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 85 _ BAR _ 50 _ BAR _ 52 _ BAR _
Cashflow _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 81 _ BAR _ 55 _ BAR _ 60 _ BAR _
Investments _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 75 _ BAR _ 131 _ BAR _ 134 _ BAR _
( 101 ) The table shows that the return on capital has largely developed in parallel to the return on sales ( see above ) .
Cash flow follows roughly the same trend , i.e. it declined from 2001 to 2003 and recovering slightly in the UZ .
The decline in return on capital and cash flow reflects the fact that average selling prices fell faster than the average cost of goods sold .
( 102 ) The Community industry has increased its investment .
They were mainly used renew existing existing and machines , less to build new production facilities .
( 103 ) However , the possibilities of the Community capital for capital capital credit credit or parent parent were not not impaffected during the the period , because companies belong to larger corporations .
The capital acquisition are therefore primarily primarily on the Group of the Group and not necessarily on the circumstances in the business concerned .
this factor should therefore be irrelevant to this investigation .
5.6 Employment , productivity and wages
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Number of employees _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 91 _ BAR _ 92 _ BAR _ 93 _ BAR _
Productivity ( ton / employees ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 96 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _
Wages _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 84 _ BAR _ 82 _ BAR _ 82 _ BAR _
( 104 ) As can be seen from the table , the Community industry reduced the number of its workers from 2001 to the UZ .
the increase between 2003 and the UZ can be explained by an increase in production .
Productivity was largely constant during the reference period .
( 105 ) Wages declined significantly in 2002 , but then remained constant until the UZ .
This was for to was a restructuring programme that year , as the development of production and employment employment above shows .
5.7 Amount of actual dumping range
( 106 ) The dumping maramping are listed in the section on dumping .
they are clearly above the threshold .
Moreover , the impact of the actual dumping range cannot be irirrelevant given the volume and prices of dumped imports .
5.8 Effects of previous dumping or subsidy practices
( 107 ) The Community industry has not recovered from the effects of previous dumping or subsidy practices , as no investigations investigations yet been carried out in this respect .
5.9 Conclusion on damage
( 108 ) While sales volumes and market share in the Community remained relatively relatively , Community Community industry was ted ted a a average average average average in the reference reference reference reference although although although its its changed ---Mix favour favour of igher-value types of goods .
Notwithstanding cost savings , the profit margin margin ased noticeably , so profits profits in the UZ were 55 55 below the 2001 2001 2001 2001 the profit profit margin significantly below the level that would have been expected without duned imports .
( 109 ) The deterioration in the situation of the Community sector in the reference period is also reflected in the reduction in production and production capacity , the decline in wages , employment , return on capital and cash flow and in a lack of growth despite reduction in average prices in 11 % .
( 110 ) These negative developments fell at a time of relatively constant productivity , increasing investments and better capacity utilization .
the development of inventories capital raising opportunities was was considered considered meaningfor the reasons set out above .
( 111 ) Taking into account all these indicators , it is provisionvisionally that the Community industry in the UZ has caused significant damage within the meaning of Article 3 of the General Regulation .
d . CCS
1 . Preliminary remark
( 112 ) It was also examined whether there was a causal link between ded ed imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China and damage to the Community economy .
Other known factors were examined than than ded ed imports , which have have damaged the Community industry at the same time to ensure that any damage caused by these other factors was not attributed to dumped imports .
2 . Effects of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China
( 113 ) As already shown above , the volume of imports from the People Republic Republic of China rose by around 150 % and their market share by 118 % in the reference period .
As set out under recital 85 , the prices of imports from the People Republic Republic of China also decby by 22 % and a price price has was found ( see Recital 86 ) .
In response to imports , the Community industry retained its sales volume ( in as not jejeopardise economies of scale ) , but had to significantly reduce its prices .
This price reduction led , among other things , to a decline in profitability in 55 ability .
profitmakes profitis significantly significantly than expected in this type of expected ; this level is no longer sustainable .
3 . Effects of imports from third countries
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Imports from other countries than the PR China _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 90 _ BAR _ 140 _ BAR _ 141 _ BAR _
( 114 ) It is highly unlikely that imports originating in third countries such as the Republic of Korea and Brazil may have helped to damage the Community economy .
The market share of imports from other countries than the People &apos;s Republic of China in the U3 was in around U% .
In addition , the average prices of imports from the Republic of Korea and Brazil ( i.e. third countries alongside alongside People People Republic Republic of , from from which largest largest were were ) ) were 25 % 47 47 % higher than the prices of imports originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
Given the market share and the relatively high prices of imports from other third countries , it can be concluded that these imports , , at at , , have made a minimal contribution to damto the Community economy .
4 . Impact of competition between Community producers and overcapacity
( 115 ) Some interested parties claimed that the Community industry was been to reduce its its to to to damdamaging due to to capacity capacity the the the -@ capacity .
However , the capacity utilization identified in the investigation for the reference period , the development of which is listed in indexed form under recital 90 , does not confirm this allegclaim .
Rather , it was comparable to the capacity utilization of the steel industry and other similar industries .
Although though capacity was reduced reduced prices prices fell , it was primarily a response to the increase in dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
the Commission also points out that a comprehensive restructuring of the Community , Community Community Community Community Community took place at the end of the 1990s .
5 . Effects of Developments in the Steel Industry
( 116 ) It was claimed claimed that technical progress that enabling the the production of longer life stones and efficient efficient steel has caused damage to the Community economy .
during the investigation , several steel producers ators that their consumption of magnesia â -@ stones per tonne of steel steel had lined as a result of technical progress .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Steel production EU . -@ 25 ( kilotons ) _ BAR _ 180531 _ BAR _ 180758 _ BAR _ 183441 _ BAR _ 185197 _ BAR _
Consumand of Magnesia â . @ Stones EU b -@ 25 ( in tons ) _ BAR _ 399563 _ BAR _ 397203 _ BAR _ 401499 _ BAR _ 400638 _ BAR _
Stone consumption in the steel industry ( tons per kilotonne ) _ BAR _ 2,21 _ BAR _ 2,20 _ BAR _ 2,19 _ BAR _ 2,16 _ BAR _
this table shows that Magnesia -@ stones only only for about 2 % of steel production .
a decline in this share would therefore not explain the decline in selling prices and profitability described in the section on section .
for this reason , it is held that the higher technical quality of the stones have have have been a cause cause to damage to the Community economy .
( 117 ) The investigation revealed that some steel producers ators continue to produce a certain proportion of nesnesia --@ stones themselves .
However , there are no signs that this practice would have been expanded over time .
Moreover , since no steel company worked as the investigation as a nesnesnesnesnesia @ stones , it can be expected that this production sector had no effect on the economic situation of the Community industry .
6 . Effects of exchange rate fluctuations
( 118 ) Another factor allegedly responsible for the damage was the change in the exchange rate of the dollar and the euro .
this could be important , the Chinese renrenbi bi been linked to the dollar dollar many years ; alaldly dly the fluctuations in exchange exchange exchange of dollar dollar and euro have made export to the community more attractive to Chinese manufacturers .
( 119 ) However , the dollar ’ s the dollar against the euro did not always coincide with the rise in imports .
The decline in the dollar price began in June 2002 , while imports increased significantly in 2001 .
In addition , freight costs from the People &apos;s Republic of China to the Community increased considerably during the reference period .
If ports from the the People Republic Republic of China would only increased because because conditions conditions had improved as a result of the change , , , a or or , in any stabilistabilistabilistabiliof would would would expected expected expected as as the freight freight costs compensoffset offset the exchange rate change .
Although such compensation compensation actually actually place ( in the last 15 months of edreference period , freight costs rose by around 25 % according to P &amp; O Nedlloyd ) , imports continued to increase .
( 120 ) For this reason , it is concluded for the visionbeing that the the of the exchange rate changes can hardly have to to damage to the Community economy .
7 . Effects of imports of the Community industry into the Community
( 121 ) Some interested parties claimed that the damage was self-caused because the Community industry introduced the affected goods from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
As set above , imports ports the People People Republic Republic of China accounted 5 % % total total total the Community Community Community in the the of 5 % I , total part of the Community market .
the share and difference between the prices of these imports compared to Community sales are relatively low and cannot have had a greater impact on the market .
8 . Impact of Community exports
( 122 ) In the UZ , the Community industry accounted around 27 % of its production from the Community .
the export volume decreased only slightly during this period .
However , the profitability of these exports was higher than that of Community sales , so it cannot be be that they they helped to damage the Community economy .
9 . Conclusion on the cause of damage
( 123 ) As already pointed out , the damage in this case was primarily in the form of price pressure , which caused a decline in profitability .
Taking into account the fact that the prices of rapidly increasing imports from the People People Republic Republic of were well well below those of the Community economy , there is is that that that the factors mentioned factors have have been a cause cause to significant significant damage to the Community economy .
No other factors were found during the investigation that could have caused the significant damage .
( 124 ) On the basis of this analysis of the impact of all known factors on the situation of the Community industry , it is is visionvisional that there is a causal link between dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China and the significant damage to the Community economy .
E. COMMUNITY INTERINTER
1 . General considerations
( 125 ) It was examined whether there elling reasons for the conclusion that the introduction of anti-umping umping duties on imports from the country concerned would run counter to Community interest .
the Commission sent questionnaires to importers , industrial users and suppliers .
Answers came from one of 14 users , five suppliers and three independent introducers .
( 126 ) The following conclusions were drawn on the basis of information received by the cooperating parties .
2 . Interest in the Community industry
( 127 ) As is well known , the Community industry has four manufacturers who employ around 800 people in the production and sale of the goods concerned .
It should also be remembered that the economic indicators examined examined for the Community industry showed a deterioration in business results during the reference period .
Despite the slight improvement in the UZ , the Community industry could not achieve satisfactory satisfactory financial situation due to dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
( 128 ) It is obvious that in in event event a waiver of measures measures more and more production facilities facilities the Community will be closed and that steel steel will will much much more on on the Chinese goods .
there are currently only a few production sites worldwide , and the majority of the raw materials ( especially magnesium oxide ) are located in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
For this reason , there are no major sources of supply in other third countries .
As a result , the introduction of anti-dumping measures would be obviously useful to the Community industry .
( 129 ) For these reasons , it is provisionally concluded that the introduction of anti-dumping measures be in the interests of the Community industry .
3 . Interest of independent importers
( 130 ) Four companies answered the questionnaire for independent importers , although only two of them introduced the affected goods in the UZ .
the cooperating importers opposed the introduction of measures and claimed that there there only a few manufacturers manufacturers of fractory tory products in Community Community and imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China had stimulated competition in the Community market .
Should measures were introduced and prices rise rise Chinese Chinese companies reduce reduce their Community sales and and would would would losses losses from reduced activity and lower profitability .
( 131 ) An importer argued that he may have to close his operations with eight employees , since the goods concerned had a significant share in his business activities .
However , the aim of the anti-dumping measures is not to prevent the import of the goods concerned nor to make the the of of importers in the difficult .
As the proposed measures relate only a relatively small part of the total cost of the Community steel industry and and and relations relations between between Chinese manufacturers manufacturers and and users based based specific technical technical requirements , imimimimimimimimimimlikely likely continue continue if anti-dumping measures are introduced to dumped imports .
( 132 ) In addition , it was found that an introduction of measures would have other significant significant would have other other , , , the goods concerned concerned only for less less less 1 1 % the the company &apos;s turnover .
4 . Interest of suppliers
( 133 ) The suppliers who worked on the investigation supported the process .
two companies supplsupplied the Community ’ s with with the most raw raw for nesnesnesnes-stones stones stones ( ( stillmagnesnesnesclaimed claimed they they they stopped stopped the the the the the ---industry a few years ago ago raw raw raw materials materials the Republic Republic Republic Republic of and later later later nesnesnesia stones stones stones the People People Republic of China were launched on the market .
5 . Interest of users
5.1 Preliminary remark
( 134 ) 14 user companies , i.e. steel producers , answered the questionnaire aire another manufacturer manufacturer and opinions the the Steel Economic opinions .
Another user supported the Community &apos;s request , but all other steel companies companies opposed the introduction of anti-dumping measures .
In total , , accounaccounted ted for 38 38 of the the consumption consumption nesnesnesia -@ Steine .
5.2 highly sensitive goods
( 135 ) Reffractory materials are of the highest strategic importance for the steel industry .
the entire steel passes through convernes, , stones stones and wpans with magnesia and @ stones .
Supply difficulties could therefore have significant consequences in the form of production interruptions , repairs or security problems .
for this reason , stones of high quality , i.e. high service life , and good technical support are very type in this type very goods .
Due to the high technical requirements , a lot of time , high investments and research are required for the development of a supplier relationship .
also from a Chinese manufacturer to another manufacturer would also be very difficult .
the steel producers claimed claimed that in the last two years they they made good progress with with manufacturers manufacturers and and in in the the , , , through improvements in efficiency and innovation .
( 136 ) The companies objecting to the introduction of measures therefore fear that there could be bottlenecks in the supply of high-quality stones and adequate technical support .
they fear that Chinese manufacturers would withdraw from the Community market in the case of the introduction of measures .
In addition , the largest occurrences magmagnesite , the most raw raw material for nesnesia -@ stones , are located in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
the steel industry is fears that its relations with Chinese raw material suppliers could deteriorate .
( 137 ) As , as stated above above , the anti-dumping measures are not aimed at prevent the import of the goods concerned or to make the activity of steel producers more difficult .
this means that non-damaging imports could continue to be introduced into the Community .
Consequently , existing relations with Chinese exporters could be maintained maintained if anti-dumping measures were introduced to dumped imports .
This is also supported by the fact that the goods concerned have only such an insignificant share in the total production costs of steel producers producers that measures have have minor minor impact on the costs of users ( see Recital 142 ) .
( 138 ) It should also be borne in mind that the goods goods are of strategic importance for the steel industry .
in the event of a waiver of measures , there is a risk that the entire production of the goods goods will be transferred to the People Republic Republic the China in the long term .
Given that there are no major manufacturers in other third countries , such dependence on Chinese imports is clearly not a sustainable scenario for the steel industry
( 139 ) In addition , there is no evidence that the access of raw materials of the steel producers who who Magnesnesnesnes-stones stones for their own , could be more difficult .
5.3 Market structure
( 140 ) The user industry claimed that the measures would strengthen a market structure with a few major manufacturers .
Users arguclaimed ed that lack of competition was was the result mergmergand acquacquisitions the the --Fire Festival in the 1990s .
( 141 ) The largest manufacturer in the community had a market share of around 30 % in the UZ , which is hardly be enough to control and control the market .
This is underpinned by the fact that this market share declined as a result of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
As pointed out above these imports ports most likely likely to continue after the introduction of measures .
In addition , many small companies in the community and even some steel companies themselves produce nesnesia -@ @ stones , and during the investigation no evidence was presented that the major manufacturers in the community dominated the market in the alleged way .
since no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour has been presented , the claim remains unfounded and unproven .
5.4 Higher costs
( 142 ) The steel industry also claimed ed that anti-umping umping duties on nesnesia stones stones stones incincadditional costs on the the prisensitive sensitive steel market , especially in competition with steel producers from third countries .
For this reason , anti-dumping duties would affect the competitiveness of the steel industry , especially since the pressure on the markets for other raw materials for steel products is also very strong .
( 143 ) Nevertheless , the answers ses of the user industry the questionquestionnshow show that the nesnesia -@ @ stones account account for well below 1 % of the total cost .
As a result , the proposed anti-dumping duties would have have a marginal impact on the total cost of steel production .
recent developments in the steel industry clearly show a recovery in selling prices and profitability , further reducing reducing the of of nesnesia share in total sales sales .
5.5 Conclusion on the interest of users
( 144 ) Given view of egegoit , it is likely unanti-danti-dumping measures Community the Community market cut cut supply supply or or competition competition competition especially as the nesnesnesia are are continue to maintain their market share .
the increase in costs would only be marginal and would not significantly affect the competitiveness of the steel industry .
for these reasons , it is visionheld provisiontime held that the interests of users do not oppose the introduction of measures .
6 . Conclusion on the Community interest
( 145 ) The introduction of measures -imports of Magnesia stones stones originating in the country concerned be clearly in the interests of the Community industry .
As terms of importers / traand and industries industries , any impact on the prices of Magnesnesia -stones stones likely to be minor .
By contrast , the market of market and and profitability of the Community economy and the decline in its prices are clearly larger scope .
( 146 ) In view of the foregoing , it is is visionvisionthat that that there elling elling elling elling the the introduction anti-anti-anti-umping duties duties duties imof nesnesnesnesnesstones stones originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
F. ANTIDUMPINGMREASMS
1 . Damage removal threshold
( 147 ) In view of the conclusions on dumping , damage and Community interests , measures should be introduced to prevent further damage to the Community sector by dumped imports .
( 148 ) Cuduties duties shall be at at a height sufficient to eliminate the damage caused by these imports exceeding the identified dumping range .
In determining the tariff required to eliminate the the damdamdamdam, , was was that that measures measures Community Community Community the to to its production production costs and achieve achieve achieve profit profit profit profit profit profit could could be be an an of of this in the the normal normal normal field , , , without dumped imports , the sale sale of similar goods in the Community .
This calculation was based on profit profit profit before of 8 % % of revenue on the basis of profit marmarbefore the rence of dumped imports .
on this basis , a non-damprice of the commodigoods was determined for the Community industry .
the non-damaging price was determined on the basis of the production costs plus the aforementioned profit margin of 8 % .
( 149 ) The necessary price increase was then determined by comparing the average average import price with the damaging price .
import prices were corrected by 10 % for three reasons .
Firstly , the production facilities of the Community sector were near the steel mills , while the cost of ting ting the import port and the insurance costs for imports were usually higher .
Secondly , the price charged by Community Community industry the the the respective respective ills during sale sale included technical support , which was usually not the case with extors .
Thirdly , all sales of the Community sector were at at the level of consumers , , many import import were were at the level of traders who had additional costs .
( 150 ) Any differences resulting in the comparison were expressed as a percentage of the average cif --@ import value .
the comparison was made on the basis of the product groups formed according to PCN --@ numbers ( see Recital 11 ) .
( 151 ) The relvisional damage damage margins for companies granted either individual treatment or market economic status were :
- Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 17,1 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 42,1 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Kyushu Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 21,9 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Guangyang Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 21,9 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Qinghua Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 54.6 % _ BAR _
- Dashiqiao Sanqiang Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 66.1 % . _ BAR _
( 152 ) In connection with the calculation of the nationwide damage thresthresthreshold for all other exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China , it must be taken into account that the cooperation was low .
for this reason , a range was calculated on the basis of the data of those cooperating exporters who were not granted to MWB nor IB .
As this damage thresthreshold was lower than the the damage damage in the case of the listed listed listed , and in order not to reward non-cooperation , the nationwide damage damage was determined at the level of the highest range detected above , i.e. 66.1 % .
2 . Preliminary measures
153 ) On the basis of the foregoing , it was held held , in accordance Article Article 7 ( 2 of of the Regulation Regulation Regulation , visional anti-dumping duties duties be imported imthe of of the goods concerned concerned originating in the People of Republic of China .
in accordance with the lower customs rule , anti-dumping duties should be set at the amount of the umping or or damage , depending on on lower lower is lower .
as the cooperation was low , the residual range was be set in the highest highest highest highest the for operating operating operating operating operating i.e. i.e. i.e. i.e. i.e. of of of 6.f f f f f f free free Community free free , of the Community .
the company-specific anti-dumping duty rates out in this Regulation were set on the basis of the findings of this investigation .
they thus reflect the situation of the companies during this investigation .
In contrast to the nationwide tariffs for all all other companies , , these rates rates apply apply apply to imports of of goods originoriginoriginin the country country and are manufactured by the legal persons named legal name .

( 2 ) This procedure ultimately led to the introduction of a final anti-dumping duty with Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 &#91; 3 &#93; to eliminate the harmful effects of dumping .
B. ANTRY ON INTROITTION OF INTERINTERRETRSLATION
( 3 ) Has Çelik ve Halat Sanayi Ticaret A.S. ( hereinafter referred to to as HHÇelik &quot; or &quot; applicant &quot; &quot; , a Turkish Turkish manufacturer of certain iron iron steel steel ropcables es to the applicable anti-dumping measures , applied for a partial interim review of Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 .
4 . This request to Article Article ( 3 ) of the the Regulation Regulation Regulation that the the relating the dumping on the basis of which the measures measures have been introduced have changed and that these changes are permanent .
( 5 ) According to the application , the applicant has made structural changes , which had a significant impact on the normal value .
In addition , the applicant argued that a comparison of the normal value based on his expense or domestic prices with export prices to the Community would result result a umping umping umping umping would be significantly below the the anti-umping umping % of 17.8 8 % on the imports improduced .
Therefore , maintaining the measures at their current level based on the previously determined dumping range was no longer longer to compensate the dumping .
( 6 ) After consultations in the Advisory Committee , the Commission concluded that there there was sufficient evidence to justify the of of a partial interim im , so that it published a corresponding announcement &#91; 4 &#93; and and an an investigation limited to determining the existence of dumping by the applicant .

d . WARE


12 . As the previous investigation investigation , the also that that the R R R manufactured the ssTurkey Turkey Turkey Turkey Turkey Turkey Turkey Turkey the Community Community the the same same material and and uses , so that they they to be regarded as similar commodity within the meaning of Article 1 ( 4 ) of the Basic Regulation .
E. DUMPING
Normal value
( 13 ) In the course of determining the normal value , it was initially examined whether the domestic sales of the similar goods made by the applicant were representative compared to its export sales to the Community .
This was the case because the quantities sold sold Germany , in accordance with Article 2 2 2 of of the the Regulation , compted to at least 5 % of its total export 2 to the Community .
( 14 ) Subsequently , each types the types sold by the the on the the market , , , to to the the of investigation investigation were directly comparable to the types carried into the the , it was investigated whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative within the meaning of Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation .
this was considered given if the total total of domestic sales of a type during the examination period period at at least 5 of of the total of export sales of the same type to the Community .
for most of the types ported to the Community during the period of investigation , a comparable type sold in representative quantities on the domestic market could be determined .
( 15 ) For the types of goods that reached the 5 % threshold , it was then examined whether domestic sales could be seen as transactions in normal transactions by determining the share of profitable sales to independent customers .
in all cases , more than 80 % of the total domestic sales of the respective type were profitable , so that the normal value was based on weighweighaverage of all domestic sales during the period of period .
( 16 ) For the types types in the Community , for which , to to the the the , , market comparable comparable were the the the the , , the value value in in 2 2 2 2 2 ) ) and and of the the Regulation Regulation was on on basis basis basis the applicant &apos;s costs costs for for the the in in question question plus plus an for for administrative administrative administrative overoverheads ( eineineinreferred referred to &quot; VVVG -@ @ costs &quot; ) and for profits .
the VVG --@ costs were based on those recorded by the applicant in domestic sales of the similar goods .
the profit margin was based on those achieved by the applicant in domestic sales of the similar goods in normal trade .

17 17 ) Since exports exports of the goods concerned were sold directly to independent customers in the Community , the export price was determined in accordance with Article 2 ( 8 8 of the Regulation Regulation on the basis of the prices actually paid or paid or paid .
Comparison
( 18 ) The comparison of the normal value with the export price was place at the level ex works and at the same trading level .
in the interests of a fair comparison , corrections were been out accordance accordance accordance Article 2 2 2 ) 10 of the the Regulation for for demondemondemoncosts costs costs costs costs costs costs costs costs costs costs costs costs costs costs costs costs , costs costs and inciary costs , borrocosts costs their comparability .
Dumping range
19 19 ) In accordance with Article 2 ( 11 11 of the Regulation Regulation , the weighaverage average corrected normal value value compared compared weighaverage average average average price price price the the the the of of to to determine the dumping range for each type of goods .
( 20 ) This comparison revealed that there was no dumping .
F. THANGE CHANGE OF VIANENT
( 21 ) In accordance with Article 11 ( 3 ) of the the Regulation , it was also examined examined whether it reasonreasonably assumed that the circumstances have changed permanently .
( 22 ) In this respect , the investigation showed that the applicant has made structural changes with a significant impact on production and organization , which resulted significantly significantly higher production efficiency thus thus a in in production costs , so that the normal was lower lower to that that the the investigation period of the previous investigation ( 1 1 1999 1999 March 31 , 2000 ) .
Export prices rose during , same prices increased and the investigation showed no evidence that this increase was only temporary .
( 23 ) It is therefore concluded concluded that circumstances have changed permanently , , particular particular to increase increase in prices of exports to the Community and the simultaneous decline in production costs .
g . ANTIDUMPINGMASASASMS
( 24 ) Since no dumping has been established , the measures should the applicant should be lifted .
( 25 ) The interested parties were informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which an amendment to Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 should be recommended and were given opportunity opportunity to comment .
( 26 ) As a result , the EEA submitted a a general general , , mainly to rising rising commodity prices after the period under investigation .
the ERIS did not question question the above umping umping umping , but expressed concern concern that the applicant could re-practice dumping again .
( 27 ) In regard case of raw material prices , it should be noted that they may have en en after the investigation investigation investigation but this could not be taken into account in the dumping examination for the applicant .
in the present case , the most important raw material is rolling wire , a simple steel product , the prices of which usually fluctuate quickly .
Therefore , an increase in the prices of such a raw material cannot be seen as a permanent change , could could alidate the above findings .
( 28 ) Finally , it should be noted that the measures will only be ted ted for applicant applicant not not for as as whole whole , so , in accordance Article Article 11 ( 6 ) of the the Regulation Regulation , applicants ants to be in the the and and be re-examined examined the context of a later review carried out for Turkey -
