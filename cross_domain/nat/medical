No interactions with other medicines were observed in studies studies which Yarvitan was administered simultaneously with NSAIDs ( carprofen , meloxicam ) or ACE --@ inhibitors ( Enalapril , benazepril ) .
Interactions with other types of medicines have not been specifically investigated .
the absorption of fat-soluble drugs while simultaneously with mitratapid was not investigated .
Therefore , dogs who receive other medicines other medicines should be closely monitored with regard to drug interactions .
4.9 Dosage and type of use to enter .
the veterinary medicinal product is be administered once a day at a dosage of 0.63 mg mitratapid / kg body weight ( corresponding to 1 ml of the drug per 8 kg ) .
to ensure the correct dosage , the dog should be weighed on day 1 and day 35 ( i.e. at the beginning of each treatment period ) .
the veterinary medicinal product should be administered together with the food .
use the dosing pipsupplied with the drug for administration .
during the first 21 – -@ day treatment , the amount of feed of the animal may remain unchanged .
then the dog should be fed according to his maintenance needs ( this is to be be ated by the veterinarian ) .
this can be achieved either with normal animal feed or with a diet food ( with a reduced amount of calories ) .
in clinical trials , the treated animals increased rapidly after the end of treatment if the diet was not restricted .
In order to avoid this rapid gain weight gain ( rebound ) , restrictive feeding must be after after maintenance maintenance after the end of treatment with the drug .
the therapy with Mitratrapid should be limited to a treatment passage for a dog .
4.10 Overdose ( symptoms , emergency measures , antidotes ) , if necessary
after a 3- or 5 --@ overdose dose in dogs , the symptoms symptoms observed observed observed soft or liquid stst, vomiting iting salialiation , anorexia , severe weight loss loss emaciated appearance , dehydration and pale mucous membranes .
In the of an accidental overdose , symptomatic therapy should be carried out .

Mitratapid and its metabolites bind to a very proteins extent &gt; 99 99 % ( &gt; plas% ) and are distributed in the tissues .
the brain is not affected , which is why a central effect of the veterinary medicinal product can be ruled out .
the excretion takes place quickly and predominantly via the fels .

Pharmacological PROATES
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Macrolide antibiotics , ATCvet @ Code :
QJ01FA95
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Gamithromycin is an azalide from the group of semi-synthetic thetic macroliantiantibiotics , consisting of a 15 -@ @ C lacon ring with a characteristic alkylated nitrogen atom at position 7A .
this special chemical structure enables the rapid absorption with physiological pH H -@ value and the long duration of action in the target tissue lungs .
Macrolide antibiotics have both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects , as they interinterrupt bacterial protein synthesis by binding ding to the ribosomal 50S S -@ subunit and thus preventing the prolongation of the peptide chain .
in at -@ vitro --@ Data prove that gamithromycin acts bactericidal .
these pathogenic germs are most often involved in the Federal Republic of Germany .
the following MHK and MBK --@ data come from representative samples of field disolates within various geographical regions of the EU .

These include the change in the ribosomal binding site , the use of active efflux mechanisms and the production of inactivating enzymes .
5.2 Information on Pharmacokinetics
Gamithromycin at a dosage of 6 mg / kg body weight is quickly absorbed after the subcutaneous injection in the neck cutthe cattle .
maximum plasma concentrations are achieved after 30 to 60 minutes .

ZUBRIN
Summary of the EPAR for the public
this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) , which explains how the Committee on Medicinal Products for VeterUse Use ( CVMP ) esses esses the documents submitted in order to make recommendations on the application of the veterinary medicinal product .
this document cannot replace the personal conversation with the veterinarian .
If you need more information about the medical condition or treatment of your animal , please contact your veterinarian .
If you would like more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( which is also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Zubrin ?
Zubrin is a lyophilisate for taking , i.e. a kind of tablet that quickly disintegrates after contact with moisture , e.g. when placed on the dog &apos;s tongue .
Zubrin contains the effective ingredient tepoxalin .
WEHERFOR is Zubrin used ?
Zubrin is used in dogs against inflammation and pain relief in acute and chronic diseases of the musculoskeletal system .
Zubrin is administered to the dog once a day about 1 --@ 2 hours after feeding , until the animal goes better again .
However , since side effects may occur , any treatment should be carried out over more than 1 - 2 weeks under regular veterinary control .
how does Zubrin work ?
Zubrin contains tepoxalin , which belongs to the drug class of so-called non-steroidal antiphlogisdrugs ( NSAID ) .
Zubrin works by blocking the enzymes cyclooxygenase – -@ 1 and cyclooxygenase â -@ 2 .
when these enzymes are blocked , less prostaglandin is formed .
Since the prostaglandine are substances that cause inflammation , tepoxalin reduces inflammation and swelling of muscles or joints and the associated pain .

the best results were achieved when Zubrin was administered 1 - 2 hours after feeding .
However , since side effects may occur , any treatment should be carried out over more than 1 - 2 weeks under regular veterinary control .

5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
tepoxalin is a double cyclooxygenase and 5 --@ lipoxygenase â -@ inhibitor with anti-inflammatory effect .
the oral administration of 10 mg tepoxalin / kg body weight leads to an inhibition of prostaglandin and leukototas --@ synthesis .
5.2 Information on Pharmacokinetics
2 hours ) .
after administration of a therapeutic dose of 10 mg / kg , the Cmax of tepoxalin in fed dogs was 1.08 ± 0.37 µg / ml ( low-fat feed ) and 1.19 ± 0.29 µg / ml ( high-fat feed ) .
the absorption of tepoxalin is favoured by administration to fed dogs .
tepoxaline is significantly converted into its acid metabolites .
the acid metabolite is a highly effective cyclooxygenase â -@ inhibitor and prolongs the efficacy of the mother substance .
in the dog , the plasma concentrations of the acid metabolite are higher than those of the parent substance .
after multiple administration over a wide dose range , no accumulation of tepoxalin or its acid metabolite was detected .
tepoxalin and its metabolites are highly bound , i.e. over 98 % bound to proteins .
tepoxalin and its metabolites are excreted via the zes ( 99 % ) .
