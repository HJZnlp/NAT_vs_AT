The message window is usually hidden , but is displayed when external commands are executed , such as compiling a file or project project error analysis , search search and many other operations .
Messages in the preset foreground color ( usually black ) are normal messages . Orange messages are warerts , and red represent errors . Warnings and error messages are linked : a double click on such a message opens the corresponding file in the respective line number .
For example , if you compile a file containing contains errors , red messages will explain the problems and point the error location , and double-clicking on such a message opens the file and lighting the line with the error .
the terminal window is a terminal --ememulator where you can enter commands commands in the GNOME ME GNOterminal .
