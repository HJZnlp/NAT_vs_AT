Pidge is right .
I &apos;m just a jump .
I am not leader .
now I am not even worthy to be a paladin .
what was it ?
the red lion .
you have to go to him .
never , Keith straighhim him to earing off my head .
calls you ?
I would prefer nothing . but the red is not intended for me .
-he chooses you .
-I don &apos;t understand .
my father created Voltron . but Zarkon is a better leader in battle , so he became Voltron &apos;s right hand .
Lance , when you accepted Keith as the new leader of Voltron , it showed that a strong team is more important to you than your urge for fame .
my father .
I don &apos;t disappoint him .

there are still only three .
where is the rest of the gang ?
we increase the pressure . Let &apos;s see who rushes to help .
Zethrid , shoot with the black cannon the the cannon .
why ?
this lion is slightly different .
his pilot does not have full control .
and Zethrid ? just one strip shot .
we do not want permanent damage .

-eith , what should we do ?
-we attack .
can you be more precise ?
we need a plan !
Keith !
I &apos;m fine .
but we can &apos;t make it on our own .
not necessary .
now it is slowly getting exciting .
-What was it ?
-The Alteic spaceship .
does anyone need help ?
Thank you , Coran .
Zethrid . You have been waiting for that .
fire the the tean ship with everything .
yes , sir !
when anyone is there , they surely comes out .
we draw attention to the ship .

the lion has it full of it !
be careful with him .
fly your own lion , Keith .
-That was intention !
-That runs far too chaotic .
we organize .
Keith , what should we do ?
we must form Voltron , but we lack a lion .
.
-Allura ? -Yes !
awesome !
there are now five kittens .
your orders , sir ?
should we shoot ?
No , we have seen enough .
Return .

it was on the tiump , but yes , we made it .
Allura , you and the blue lion ?
cool
yes , that was a surprise , but a joyful one .
we now know that Zarkon has a son .
- This is deeply disturbing .
-we need to find out more .
blue , we had some nice adventures .
I wanted to stay with you , but wishes are not always fulfilled .
I &apos;ll miss you buddy .
pink ? not what I expected .
but I like it .
yes , on Altea we wear this color in honor of our fallen warriors .
I wear them in honor of the old paladines .
and Shiro .
that belongs yours .
I had to lose the blue . at least to you .
Princess
the black lion flies away !
-eith , where do you want to go ?
to Lotors ship is a rope transmitter .
fetch all your lions .
we are pursuing them .
you wanted me to to lead Voltron .
Lotor is on the other side .
in an hour we are close to the attack .

formation .
sorry .
is an attack a good idea ?
not everyone comes along with his lion .
-Do you mean me ? -you ?
No
No , certainly not .
but half of the team is in new lions .
maybe we should not take over .
tell our heat-headed leader .
you wanted me as a leader , now you complain .
Lotor is the heir of GalGalra -@ Ththrone .
we end his rule .
Allura , all ok in the blue ?
yes , I fw half my life the castle - -@ ship .
I just have to get used to the lion .
then we start the attack .
in a Varga , the lions arrive .
your commands ?
we should shoot .
we heard that all five lions are ready for use .
but otherwise we know little .
keep the ship on track until my return .
makes my hunter ready to go .
I attack the lions myself .
you cannot defeat them alone .
I don &apos;t intend that .
-There is a movement .
-so much on the subject of surprise .
this is just a hunter .
where are others ?
They hide .
we turn it off .
-Lance , what is it ?
-Sorry !
the red is unusual fast for me .
where is the hunter ?
come , move !
I can &apos;t shake him off .
drives him .
I come .
Allura !
- Sorry , Keith .
seriously , does the thing braking ?
Allura !
Allura !

he plays us against each other .
- That must be lotor . -Au !
Allura , everything ok with you ?
yes , but the control does not go like the lock --@ ship .
what &apos;s wrong , lion ? Do what I command you .
move !
we should tell Allura that the lions work differently .
I told her not to roar him .
she covered me .
yes , forget it .
She scares me .
I can hear you !
-eith , what should we do ?
-don &apos;t get in my way !
great leader .
that doesn &apos;t work out .
we must form Voltron .
People , in formation flight .
People ?
the Voltron - -@ Feeling does not come up .

it doesn &apos;t work out !
-What &apos;s going on ?
- People !
the hunter !
disappointing .
Apparently , the reality of Voltron does not do justice to the legend .
that was embarrassing .
and , do we leave it , fly back , reew , eat something ?
No
I know we have difficulties , but Lotor must not escape .
Acxa . Set course on the coordinates .
I will lure the lions there .
to the Thayserix ?

these are not the Paladines who defeated father .

How do you know ?
They do not fight as a unit and cannot form Voltron .
my father probably as as much damage to the team as they to him .
Anyway , they are vulnerable , and we have to take advantage of that .
we recaliate your hunter for the atmosphere on Thayserix .

what happens on Thayserix ?
the planet consists of dense gases and has magnetic poles that affect normal sensors .
when the lions are there , they are blind .
nothing wrong , Narti .
holds the cruiser in orbit around Thayserix .
I scare the lions , and grab them .
he hides .
we don not follow him , because what awaits expect ?
People , we have a problem !
my sensors play crazy .
presumably because of the atmosphere and the magnet --@ Poland of the planet .
We have no time .
he must not escape .
without the sensors and the equipment we do not see where up and and is or how we get out .
-we should go back . -No !
fly flying !
what ? I just heard &quot; fly . &quot;
fly back ?
do you also hear a noise ?
I see you .
-Make slower !
-we must stay .
- He escapes .
-the gases make radio contact more difficult .
we must stay together to communicate .
we survived the worst .
No ! No !
Allura was hit !
I fly after her .
Hunk !
stay with me !
Keith , we should take care of Allura .
Keith , you separate the team !
Keith , don &apos;t do that !
stop playing !
ready !
-is everyone fine ?
-Sorry I slowdown . -the blue does &apos;t listen to me .
-ok .
our team holds together .
-or , Keith ?
-it &apos;s not just about the team .
mission is more important than everyone .
we have to find Lotor and stop it . and that &apos;s exactly what I intend to .
people , we should stay together .
Prince Lotor needs your support on Thayserix .
we wait you here .
Lotor is the lion .
and they have no idea .
why doesn &apos;t he shoot ?
he could tear them in shreds .
-Blow them up !
-That is not possible .
the area is full of red syntian Ã¢ -@ nitrate , a highly explosive gas that responacts to increased light --@ emissions .
that will be good .
that is wrong .
we see practically nothing .
.
he has to be somewhere here .
I know .

-Where is he ? -Who knows ?
the radars do not work .
People . Do you also feel he playing with us ?
I see that the same way , big one .
the guy scares me .
-he deliberately luus us .
-Up there !
we have to go away !
this is a trap !
the leaf turned .
the hunters become the hunted !
Hunk , knocking sayings does not get us further !
Lance is right .
stay calm , ready .
he attacks .
forms a circle .
we must be prepared for everything .
Once you see him , you fire with everything you have .

Fire !
Hello ?
Paladine ? Help !
Wow , you can hide , but I will find you .
what happened ?
where is the rest of the team ?
that is my fault .
I am fully tapped into his trap .
everyone warned me , but I didn &apos;t want to hear .
I put the whole team .
yes , somehow already .
but now we have to .
you are right .
we withdraw .
Hello ?
does anyone hear me ?
is there anyone ?
Pidge !
Hunk !
Oh my God .
I &apos;m glad I found you .
do you repair the radar , find the rest and get us out here ?
without data constant I without data constant , which would have have before we flew into this gas gas -@ planet .
and what does that mean ?
-That is , we are sitting in the clamp .
Hello ?
can anyone hear me ?
ok , stay calm , Allura .
.
what would Lance do ?
Hallihello , blue lion .
you know ... you really activate my particle lock .
nothing works .
I tried friendly requests and orders .
what are you ask me ?
I can &apos;t .
all rely on me .
the whole universe . but I can &apos;t control everything .
I need your help .
I hear you .
help .
lead me .
I can &apos;t make it alone .
a sonar map .
Do you also think what I think , bluones ?
someone learned something .
come .
almost .
Nitrate gas !
Do the freezbeams work ?
I have no control over the left wing .
Paladin .
we managed blue .
now we must find others .
Hey , Pidge .
you would be stranded on a planet and may still eat else ...
what would that be ?
a burrito ?
you like Burritos .
I would take a burrito .
Hey , I call Pidge and Hunk .
- Are you looking Paladine a way out ?
-Madness !
you have found us !
Allura found you .
She found us all .
-She connected with the lion .
-How did you do that ?
I behaved like Lance and stopped thinking .
yes , think like Lance .
-Mmoment , do you call me stupid ?
-No , you are a natural talent .
-Yes , of course stupid .
-from birth .
it &apos;s nice to raise Lance . - but we have to find out here .
- Follow me .
I know the way . waits a tick .
we have society .
-Lotor has probably called reinforcement .
- Oh man , anything is always .
we must form Voltron .
but last time we could not form Voltron .
we have to try it .
maybe we were too divided and unorganized , we only come out here when we work together .
we are a team .
Shiro believed in us .
we must believe in ourselves .
do you think so ?
-Yes ! --then ...
Voltron !
I recognize an unknown energy @ signature .
-Hunk , I &apos;m a leg .
-Pretty cool , right ?
Lotor .
should we fly ?
No
we brought ourselves into this situation by false ambition .
we must be ready for him .
understood , team leader .
where do we fly ?
Voltron is there at the back .
we have to fight now !
a leader knows when to leave the battlefield .
we determine when we face them .
You can form Voltron again .
is a problem ?
No
.
-What is it ?
-Yes , we do not know this alarm .
Allura , what is ?
have you seen a ghost ?
.
this is an ancient emergency call .
of King Alfor&apos;s ships .
-Are en not the last Alteans ?
moment .
what if this is a trap ?
this is an ancient ship and we fly .
this is a Tel --@ Galax --@ exploration ship .
it explores the depths of the universe .
according to the identification code , the traylis is fleet cruiser .
but here is nothing goal or mission .
-What &apos;s wrong with him ?
-is this a worm hole ?
this is not a normal worm hole .
it generates huge amounts of energy where the ship is stuck .
see if someone is on board .
Need help .
we could send a drone looking closer closer .

energy is neither radioactive nor thermal .
It also does not create gravity . and the light radiates out , unlike black holes .
-but where does the light come from ?
-I know this energy . -@ signature .
this is quintessence !
not good .
ok , do we stay away from the thing , yes ?
is not possible .
have you not seen that ?
Voltron is much more stable than anything else in the universe .
we received an ancient emergency signal , so someone is on the ship .
as Paladine of Voltron we must help .
but I still believe that this could be a trap .
and it is too dangerous to fly anyway .
I fly alone when I have to .
ok , slow .
Pidge , can you explain this to me before us ?
the Euclidean space around the ship is an anomaly .
but the energy does not come from a source that fits into our reality .
that was no .
I scan for biorhythms .
strange , I receive no signs of life .
maybe not here , but the ship is bigger .
-we have to go through .
-due to the glowing inferno ?
Pidge , keep an eye on Voltron &apos;s functions .
we stop immediately when it gets tough .
understood , then we break off immediately .
People , my sensors play crazy .
we should explode just like the drone .
but somehow the room curvature does not affect Voltron .
Hello ?
what can you see ?
the connection breaks .
Hello ?
No
we have to be through . That is the nose of the ship .
Moment .
the rear part of the ship is gone .
Coran ! Coran !
we can no longer see the castle .
-Coran , do you hear me ?
and where does the planet come from ?
according to the sensors we are exactly where we were .
People , that sounds strange now , but now I receive several biorrhythms .
Alteaner .
it seems that there is only one way to find out what &apos;s going on .
Hello ?
is someone ?
here it is totally scary .
does anyone think a ghost ship ?
or just me ?
did the crew give up the ship ?
unclear . but without the spacesuits they did not come ...
there is someone in it !
Thanks to King Alfor we found the second meteorite .
we recovered him , but he causes serious disorders .
we fly to Altea , but it is unclear if we can do it .
at the moment ...
what happened here ?
something deadly .
that still does not explain the biorhythms .
Be !
-Not to grasp .
Shiro ?
...
back !
you never get the meteorite .
I die rather than leaving him to to ans .
Shiro , please .
my name not Shiro .
what is going on here ?
why does he suddenly talk so strangely ?
-You know us ?
-Of course !
you are our leader and a paladin .
and you &apos;re a slav .
I delivered you .
and you &apos;re wrong .
-That may be true . but you have never freed me from anything .

is a parallel universe .
what ?
when we flew through the energy field , we landed in a parallel universe .
such a thing SlaSlav always talks about ?
not you .
but another .
-he constantly talks about other realities .
-seems known to me .
you attacked the crew ?
-Back , woman .
-we do not have .
but it is good that they are dead .
-Oh no , even more Alteans !
-What ?
even more Alteans ?
You have noticed your arrival .
Sven , away here !
prefers to disappear .
what is going on here ?
does that mean , a bunch of teteans capates the ship ?
Weapons away !
Alteaner .
impossible .
Empress .
confused .
how was it like ?
Are Empress Allura ?
I am princess Allura .
please .
I am commander Hira , Empress .
how can it be ?
you beat down down the Galra -@ @ prpr. . You founded empire . 10,000 years ago .
where we came from , Zarkon destroyed your planet and wiped out the Alteans .
where do you come from ?
fascinating .
your theory about Voltron has been confirmed .
I had hoped to experience a firedisplay .
all previous recovery â -@ attempts , were more entertaining .
Well , not for your pilots .
Voltron got through through because is made of the same material as the meteorite that King Alfor wanted to hide from his father .
Let &apos;s see if the new Paladine bring it to us .
and when Voltron is trapped in the other dimension ?
in the other reality , Ezor .
and if Voltron is trapped in the other reality ?
Voltron stustuthere , we get rid of him .
he returns with the meteorite , we get him .
for us , both are a victory .
this is the meteorite Trayling spoke of .
he is stuck between the realities . like the ship .
can you take a sample ?
I try .
incredible .
Voltron .

it is of course not really Voltron , but the energy waves are the that Zarkon was looking for .
and those who led us to the blue lion .
so you could enter this reality .
Your vehicle is made of the same transreal material .
Voltron is so powerful .
with this material , Altea can build its own transreal ships .
we can extend our peace to all realities .
General Hira , I discovered discovered on the ship that secures tea &apos;s rule over millennia .
the Alteans of this reality have defeated the Galra ?
under your leadership , Empress .
If you had not fought and avaved your father , Altea could never have provided peace throughout the universe .
the last .
Do you think the plan works ?
worry .
I am 60 % sure , this is one of the 0.15 % realities in which this plan works 100 % .
whether the people from the other reality help the Alteans ?
if they are my friends , 72 % are likely to decide correctly .
first we had to beat Zarkon . since then we bring all worlds the true peace of Altea .
wonderful .
no stress , no wars .
-This is unimaginable . -really ?
Moxilous .
for centuries , his people have waging war against his neighboring planets .
what a barbaric life .
but look at him now .
what is different ?
the Hoktril .
the greatest technical achievement of our civilization .
what does he do ?
he deprives our enemies from their fighting enemies .
their will , one could say .
we are further .
who was still lost in Empress Allura &apos;s times is rehabilitated .
Peoples that have aged war for millennia can now live in peace and support our new order .
as part of the ancient peace movement ?
are we talking about slavery here ?
No
without will they are not slaves .
Slaves fleflee or lean up .
the controlled ones like to do what they are told .
the protection of life is a top priority in our empire .
and with eby we achieve more than we have ever dreamed .
but you take their free will .
the will that would kill you without hesitation .
Thanks to us , no innocent must die through the free will of a evil being .
Empress Allura , I show you something .
this is our tea .
with us .
Let me show you all all his splendor .
does anyone else find these guys oblique ?
Something is wrong with these alteans .
they have smashed brain big the big guy .
Huhu , up here .
how did you find us ?
-the probability was great ...
-Well , forget it .
we have to get away to Keith and Allura and the meteorites .
we are .
but you have to help us with one thing .

I suspected that forces of the Gamara are on board .
but not that Empress Allura &apos;s friends help them .
Altea .
it seemed an unrealizable dream that I never dared to dream .
Allura is not the altea you knew .
that is true .
this altea has prevented the Galra from spreading throughout the universe , as with you .
Empress , we will do everything to help you .
the meteorite on this ship can travel between realities .
If you activates this ship , we can free the ship and the meteorite from the crack .
then we fly into your universe and bring you peace . even the Galra .
thinks well about it , Allura .
even recently we thought all Galra were evil .
maybe not as easy as it does .
Keith , that is my people . that would be the strongest alliance we have .
I tried everything .
I can &apos;t find Voltron .
how should I stop them ?
you know them .
I don &apos;t understand a word , but I suppose it was an insult .
not good .
Allura .
soon we bring our peace into every reality .
what is it ?
Empress , the Gamara forces are on board .
They helped .
our friends .
Hira , you and all of Altea have transformed the universe into a slave realm .
free .
Slaves ?
is that true ?
are not slaves .
and spread chaos and destruction !
we will scan your brain and find out where the rebels are .
finally the war can end .
-Allura , we must not allow this .
-Hira , please .
we both want the same .
Peace .
Oh yes ?
by your weakness your people suffsuffer from the Galra .
but we gave our peace .
and now we bring peace to every reality .
you are not my empress .
and you are not an woman .
what to laugh ?
we are in reality where everything goes well .
perfect timing .
!

-Pidge , where are the lions ?
-left down !
Sven , everything ok ?
you saved me .
that will be again .
just takes me to the hospital .
we are stuck . to all :
hold on !
does this in every reality ?
I take care of Sven .
get your lions !
I am to blame .
I activated the spaceship .
They get the meteorites and terrorize every reality .
No , you can recapture the meteorite !
-Pidge , look for the meteorite .
-I have already placed his signature .
we fly in and get it .
Voltron !
ok , and what now ?
we can only return back at the point of our arrival .
shoot !
drive .
-Drive ready .
what &apos;s going going on ?
drive failed .
Persecution impossible .
I love this reality !
destroys them !
I !
No
you are back !
Thank you !
Paladine , do you hear me ?
ok ?
nice that my emergency signal loicyou you , Voltron .
do you hear me ? all ok ?
Coran , we still live .
Allura , you have done the right thing .
Hira was not allowed to have the meteorites .
-but now Lotor has him .
-You could not guess that .
the problem .
we are always aware .
therefore my father sent the lions away .
to protect this reality .
-Finally I understand it .
-we get him back .
and if not ?
Lotor is always one step ahead of us .
he has something to do with the meteorite ite and he succeeds , the GalGalra a weapon weapon that is as deadthal as Voltron .
ok , people , target .
I give you cover ... Hey , Keith , I would have caught it !
there are still some !
that was awesome !
Pidge , could you accelersome gas ?


super , Pidge .
-This is the last outpost here .
-Contacts the blade of Marmora .
tells them the base is free .
Well , I just know how Zarkon wanted to steal the lion and I should use the Bayard .
after that I don &apos;t know anything anymore .
I just woke up on the Galra @ ship .
you have activated the teleportation mode of the black lion .
did ported you ?
maybe he wanted to help you .
by delivering me the Galra ?
maybe Zarkon has manipulated him .
he tried to control the lion until the lion , right ?
yes , maybe .
So as soon as you feel grown , others are definitely happy to seeing you .
They need you .
yes , I try .
ok , we are on the bridge .
-Hey , Keith ?
-Yes ?
how many times will you save me before all this all over ?
as often as I have .
good work , people .
you have brought the decisive turn .
good that you have remained faithful to the mission .
you look good .
how are you ?
good , except for the funny headaches .
People , I have something .
I downloaded data from the fallen Galra @ base .
I decirypted them and found something about Lotor .
-Do you know where he is ?
-No . but his command ship was sighted in the Va &apos;Kar â -@ quadrant .
well done , Pidge .
but these quadrants are huge .
how are we supposed to find him ?
the comet is made of the same material as Voltron .
I scan for Fraunhofer -@ lines , just like the blue lion .
which are subject to free induction decay .
is exponential .
but when we amplify the sensors ...
No , too o many interferences .
-Let us increase radiradiance .
-tips of a castle !
awesome !
I only understood station .
we are now setting course on the Va &apos;Kar â -@ Quadrant .
it hurushes .
who knows what Lotor is to do with the comet ?

Hey , man , I wanted to talk to you briefly because ...
because I &apos;m worried .
definitely when you come to me .
-you are now the leader .
treasures already .
I expected .
we are now six paladins , but we have only five lions .
you are right .
Shiro takes over the black one , you want your red one .
and I would have to take Allura the blue blue .
but she learns faster than we all .
It could achieve unexpected things .
that is true .
so I would give the team a favor when I say goodbye .
what are you talking about ?
this is not about ego .
war .
it is necessary to choose the best .
Do &apos;t break your head and think of the mission .
that .
ok , thank you .
and , Lance leave the computing Pidge .
Thank you for joining .
I would never have arrived .
I know you are dirty .
I owe you a shower .
but first are we looking for Lotor , yes ?
Let &apos;s throw the thing and see if it is possible .
perhaps the polarity is not true .

I have the comet , but he moves .
Coran ?
Allura ?
can an Altean push on the castle ?
we are .
we catch up .
keep a distance so we we are not noticed .
the signal came to hold in the Ulippa â -@ system .
activate scanner .
this is not lotor .
but the comet is in it .
-Ok , people ...
-we do the following ...
Oh , I &apos;m sorry .
, Shiro .
we need the comet .
he should safely into the base .
it is vulnerable during transport .
we strike .
who , to the vulture , are these guys ?
a transport is probably not the plan .
-we need more detailed information .
-take the black lion .
I support you with Coran .
Keith , are you sure ?
yes .
-What &apos;s going on ?
-Shiro , where do you stay ?
we need you !
-eith , you have to lead the mission .
-What ?

the black lion does not react .
you are probably his paladin now .
I come .
this is the worst base in the empire .
but my base !
Victory or death !
we must find the comet .
then we find out who the guys are .
you ?
Lotor syou to finish what he started ?
we are on board .
no trace of the crew .
we are looking further .
here long .
kill him !
-No , you know the plan !
-Ma life is unimportant .
only the empire counts !
off systems .
sounds like the battle is over .
quickly .
I open the roof .
Coran , increase the picture .
...
Teludav !
what , in the name of King Grogery the the fraous , is that ?
he has to be here .
right in front of us .
where is the comet ?
in the ship ?
I think the ship is the comet .
has he built a quickly a the from the ore comet comet ?
-This is bad .
Terrible even .

in the Galra --@ base is a part of the Teludav .
who who worw Zaron &apos;s ship ?
but they can &apos;t use it without Alteanese ...
Zarkon &apos;s witch !
She had ancient times .
-is anyone still pping out here ?
-Yes , I sign up for freakout .
Lotor must be here .
we must finally turn it off .
Lotor must not have the ship .
back to the lions , and form Voltron !
why destroy the ship if we can turn off Lotor ?
he constantly outwus us .
That is why LotLotor is not allowed to get this ship .
too dangerous .
Keith , I want to stop Lotor , but Shiro is right .
ok , go to the lions .
I &apos;m looking for Lotor .
Keith , you have to stay together .
-I agree with Shiro . -I too .
-I too .
-Yes .
Well , go .
help you !
Pidge , help me !
I rarely fight against worthy opponents .
I will will destroy you .
we have no time .
to the lions !
idea
Zethrid , stop !
Come on on !
we can finally destroy them .
we have what we wanted .
stick to the plan .
seriously . What is going on here ?
who are they ?
I saw one of them in the weblum .
She stole Scaultrit .
and they have an woman ?
You want to open worm holes with the Teludav .
if the ship was out of the comet , we have completely different worries .
I thought Lotor took over for Zarkon .
why does he attack a base ?
no idea , so we must finally stop him .
-we must stop the transport ship .
-Made .
-That must be the ship from the comet .
-Caution .
Particle barrier and defense systems .
-a fast , small mistbard .
and a damn manoeuvrable .
-particle barrier is damaged .
-LPeople , where are you ?
another hit , and it &apos;s over !
sword !
Voltron until the ship is out of reach .
Don &apos;t be provoke .
the sword is deadly .
it &apos;s too fast !
People , the cargo ship escapes with the Teludav .
I thought we should destroy the comet at -@ ship .
but Lotor must not have Teludav .
Shiro is right .
destroy him .
but the comet . -@ ship is in front of our nose !
Keith , the cargo ship escapes !
good .
You must defend yourself or follow the Teludav unprotected .
-the Teludav escapes !
-eith , what now ?
lowers the shield and shoots the cargo ship . risks it .
or we beat this and then the cargo ship .
no time !
you have to decide !
Hunk , your Bayard .
we lower the shield and shoot at the cargo ship .
ready ?
ready !
They attack the cargo ship .
ready for fire .

Fire !

Your failure is extremely disappointing .
comes back before even GalGalra --ships ships appear .
so Lotor attacked the Galra @ base to steal the Teludav ?
confusing .
no matter , they escape !
-Afterwards . -No .
comes back to the castle .
we have to get out of what is going on here .
-Sorry I interfering .
-I thought I had it under control .
you must learn to set priorities .
sometimes hurts .
-I am not suitable for the leader .
-Yes , you do .
Thanks to your quick reaction , Lotor did not escape with the Teludav .
you pack .
the black lion has chosen you .
I am proud of you .
I just know that these people had the right access codes .
you have to believe me !
I do . Nevertheless you have to pay for your failure .
Ulaz ?
Operation Kuron , phase one successful .
Phase two .
Come on on !
Come on on !
Message to the command center .
Operation Kuron , phase three has started .
General Rath ...
-I have an assignment for you .
-I am in the service of Galra .
Lotor &apos;s perception is no longer so clear since he returned .
it was risky to bring him back after the absence .
I am worried about which path he been leading us ever then .
you have to keep an eye on him .
Follow his battleccruiser and tell me any suspicious behavior .
Vrepit sa .
what killed you ?
Help .
that must be the one who crashed with his pod .
Experimental Y0XT39 reacts normally to optical stimuli .
for Operation Kuron .
-What does he say ?
-hard to say , but he comes out .
-What is this noise ?
-I look .
he wakes up .
have you you put the the to him ?
-Which ?
otherwise his arm turns into a weapon .
-red ?
-we have only one force !
where am I ?
why am I connected ?
-Do we eat it ?
-it does not look like a galra .
-Then we do not eat it ?
No
-I am not a galra .
-All the worse .
a traitor .
I &apos;m not a ...
you are ...
you are rebels .

we fight against the Galra .
we did not allialliourselves with them !
I don not work for those .
I am on your side .
I am Shiro , a paladin of Voltron .
but I was captured .
I assume .
-I fought against Zarkon .
-Against Zarkon ?
Of course , and I am the phloban of Gargalax .
please , have you never heard of Voltron ?
the lion .
what happened to them ?
how much time has passed ?
the Galra have been sending spies to us for years .
and now they have sent you to listen to us ?
joke .
No , I fled .
you you fled from a Galra â -@ battleship ?
-I don not buy that from you !
-it is true .
I took a pod .
They shot at me and met my pod .
they do not with allies .
please . verify my identity at the blade of Marmora or at Voltron .
-with a traceable signal ? No .
-Look around .
our inventories here are limited .
we like to watch you starstarving until you finally tell the truth .
Prince Lotor , the scanners recognize an anomaly .
Accurate coordinates .
I want to see them .

what do you expect ?
three such phenances in one day can not be a coincidence .
Persecors ? -We would that .
-except they have the scanners â -@ protocols .
-Then they distort the measurements .
-Only the Galra can access them .
activates the heat --@ sensors and fies around the anomaly .

we shoot them down !
I want to know who is .
it is a Galra --@ combat ship .
get our guest on board .
No
Lotor requires support on Thayserix .
we wait you here .
-Thayserix ?
where is it ?
-Not far from here .
They cross the quadrant .
record this with the Klygarg .
I hate the Klygarg .
how does it work again ?
enter your password . -Sure .
what is my password ?
-don &apos;t know it &apos;s yours !
I catch a message .
-Record them .
-I didn &apos;t even record the first one .
Prince Lotor gave us an order .
we should intercept Voltron .
Voltron ?
See if he is ready to talk .
Vakala !
come here !
we should have it .
is injured .
it cannot be far .
I &apos;m looking outside , you in the tunnels .
I don &apos;t want to hurt you !
please shoot !
you never meet !
let me ! -here with it !
-No , it belongs to me !
stop immediately , otherwise I shoot !
you are on the wrong side of war .
No , not true .
I am on your side .
my name is Shiro , and as I said , I am a paladin of Voltron .
it doesn &apos;t matter what I say . You don &apos;t believe me , so ...
I have to go back to my team , and I need your help .
Thayserix .
a gigantic gas planet .
according to the news we intercepted , Voltron is there ... or he was there .
-I have to go there .
have a ship ?
-Only one shuttle to dock on ships in orbit , not to cross space .
here , excuse for hanging you on your wrist .
Thank you .
I &apos;m sorry that the weapon hit your face .
Oh , that was neither the first nor the last time .
Shiro , I see no way to Thayserix .
-What about the Galra @ cruiser ?
-What is supposed to be with him ?
he flies close past , I smuggle myself on board .
on board a Galra @ cruiser ?
you got got ed a Galra --@ ship . and now you want to break into one ?
you &apos;re crazy than me .
and I live voluntarily on an ice planet .
is it possible or not ?
the cruiser is within reach , but he immediately umps umps into the Hyper er -@ Drive .
I hurry .
Thank you for your help .
if he makes it on the battlesship and then to Voltron ?
if he the one for whom he pretends to , he has a chance .
you know this was our only ship ?
the cruiser identifies the shuttle as soon as it is within reach .
since the shuttle is so small , the bridge is not informed .
the defense system destroys everything in case of visual contact .
the sensors identify you as a world bribribris .
you have to be fast .
go to the paers .
there you get on board .
the weapons are retracted before the Hyper . -@ Drive .
Hyper . -@ Drive . Activate shields .
an attack !
Visual contact to Voltron .
Voltron is within range .
Voltron .
Hunting squadadons one ready for use .
is already coming .
sthe hunting squadron .

Voltron is out of reach .
Hunting squadron , cancel action .
Cancel action .
now or never .
Voltron !
movement !
he &apos;s too fast for me !
No
keep your henchmen off my neck .
Just like your father . The Galra â -@ empire needs clear guidance in these difficult times .
I am the ruler .
but I am not my father .
Pilots . -@ logbook .
I am a day away from Thayserix .
I have lost visual and radar contact to Voltron .
I keep my course .
I am four days away from Thayserix .
food or water .
SOS @ Signal is enabled .
no signs from anyone .
I am on the road for seven days .
the oxygen is running out , the fuel is consumed .
this will be my last entry .
what &apos;s going going on ?
we have found it .
Master , I ask forgiveness , but I know no other way .
Your empire needs you .
then we fought , there were his generals , so he stole the meteorite .
Lotor could be everywhere .
without knowing what he is up do , we never find him .
what are the connections ?
why is Voltron made of the same material as the meteorite ?
what is so special about it ?
Father discovered a meteorite before my birth .
Your father . and Zarkon .
when Zarkon was a paladin of the black lion ?
before .
before Alfor built the lions .
it hurts to talk about it , but since we want to stop lotor , we have to hear the rest .
In the beginning , the Paladine were five major leaders , although they came from cultures that were very different and have waged war for generations , they ened their differences to protect their common interests .
which was initially a a purpose alliance developed into a friendship .
a waror or or had arisen , and they together away from those who would harm them .
Oje .
I warn you again and again of solo alone , Alfor .
as an alchemist , you are much wister than than a soldier .
for that I have you , Zarkon .
the original Paladines were Zarkon of Daibazaal ,
King Alfor of Altea , Gyrgan of Rygnirath ,
Trile from Dalterion . -@ belt and Blaytz by Nalquoud .
Sit down , eat and drink with you !
Broaternization with the servant class is not allowed .
because of the discipline .
a bit less discipline would do you you , Zarkon .
I remember when Lambonit - -@ lounderers surround you .
-I had the gang well under control .
-the gang had you under control .
why do I just get involved with these crooks ?
because we are the only crooks on your side .
!
Rygnirath .
They did not know that after that night the universe would be forever forever .
we evacuated all Galra -@ inhabitants at the crater .
-What did you find out ?
-I don not know .
this meteorite is different from the others .
-material changes realities .
-What do you mean ?
Scholars have always had the theory that several realities exist .
whole other universes with stories we know nothing about .
but you could never prove it .
so now , because when we moved the meteorite we discovered this here .
is another reality ?
-What is it ?
fear .
is Kova .
-it comes from our reality .
-Zarkon . this is Honerva .
She is Altea &apos;s best alchemist .
I invited them to Daibazaal . as a head of research .
Their expertise is priceless .
Isn &apos;t that exciting ?
it could turn the understanding of the universe upside down .
find out everything you can .
I give you every support .
I have to go .
that was short .
King Alfor experimented with the ore on Altea , while Honerva continued to research on Daibass aal on the abyss .
but Alfor often came to visit , and the years passed .
Zarkon . This is princess Allura .
very pleased .
a gift in honor of your birth , princess .
Honerva tamed you .
I never thought that the great warrior was ries Zarkon , and an Altean alchemist .
Honerva , diligent as always .
Thank you for the gift .
Allura likes .
-That was just a common gesture .
-Of course .
-What does the quintessence -@ experiment do ?
-it is running .
a year with a drop of quintessence , without loss of revolutions per deosch .
there is no comparable source of energy .
my ships work according to the same principle . The ore develops by itself .
it is somehow terrifying .
infinitely strong spaceships for the Galra @ Empire .
and an endless source of clean energy for the universe .
of course .
what is it ?
I sent signals to the neighbbor . -@ reality . and this creature reded to it .
nothing from our universe survived the passage through the transition .
-but this being came through unscathed .
-What ?
I thought we wanted to be careful .
we don &apos;t know what &apos;s out there .
In viously past it was believed that lightning would come from the arrows of the gods until others was proved .
with our pursuit of knowledge , we penetrate into dangerous terrain .
Alfor and Honerva erected particle -@ barrier around the crater to stop the creatures .
but it would not last forever .
the barrier weens .
little time .
the creatures come out , my troops are overrun .
my planet , my people .
Alforum &apos;s project will save us .
-Let us hope .
I hope your plan works , Alfor .
at Rygnirath !
incredible .
Alfor are fantastic .
how do they work ?
I formed them from the meteorite . -@ ore and quintessence , so they have an endless energy --@ stock .
impressive !
the alloy with a meteorite â -@ ore makes it almost indestructible .
what armament do they have ?
now it becomes really interesting .
ancient alchemy can create great feats .
but when I tested my spaceship , I suddenly felt a kind of psychic connection .
how should I explain it ? The ship didn &apos;t just read my thoughts .
it communicated with me .
They develop .
we do not know their abilities , but we understand it over time .
over time ?
time escap, and we stand here .
Creatures of another empire soon slaughtered my people .
without these spaceships , all hope is lost !

that will be hard work .
these are not ordinary spaceships .
you don not choose the lion .
the lion .
are careful at the beginning .
They have greater energy than anything you know .
the formation .
you understand the ships .
I am an alchemist , not a military leader .
-I keep your right hand .
good .
on my sign , Paladine !
right Alfor and Blaytz !
left stem and Gyrgan !
Paladine , I fly ahead and distract it .
you attack others from all sides !
Fire !
fire !
these stupid things block me !
Blaytz !
-Thank you , Alfor !
-Always gladly .
Head head at -@ screw !
-I do not meet !
-withdrawal , Paladine !
we form .
waiting !
we are forming a new formation .
-What ? why ?
-I don &apos;t know , but I feel it .
-Hey , I feel it too !
-I too !
what is going on here ?
Voltron .
-Inbelievable , we made it !
-How did that come about ?
am I a leg ?
-These forces are simply unbelievable .
-This is Voltron .
a shield !
well done , Trigel !
-it wants to crush us !
-we have to get rid of it !
I know what we are doing .
we seal the transition .
seal the transition ?
why ? He almost destroyed Daibazaal !
the creatures almost destroyed Daibazaal . but you have defeated them .
Zarkon , you certainly agree .
it must be sealed .
.
Just look at what we have won , Alfor .
your spaceships are the most powerful machines .
what else do we discover when we continue to work ?
you risk your planet , the whole solar system ? -What what ?
for more power ?
-you know it &apos;s about more .
have Voltron .
enough .
I have in charge here !
I &apos;m sorry , Alfor .
the work continues .
Honerva continued her transition experiments .
despite their differences , Zarkon , Alfor and the Paladine established a new era of peace and prosperity .
Voltron gained fame as a defender of the universe , and the legend arose that lives continues to this day .
I heard there were three more earthquakes .
don &apos;t worry , I stabilize the planets --@ cohesion .
my scientists scanned Daibazaal .
the planet .
the integrity ...
I &apos;m &apos;t stop off Honerva &apos;s work now .
She discovers more every day !
her team developed a room cruiser that is five times larger than our ships .
but that &apos;s not all .
-Hello , Honerva .
it is Deca Durabolin . -@ Phoebs .
I hope you don &apos;t come to finish my work .
This gap contains more knowledge and power than you can ever understand .
I &apos;m just worried about the stability ...
is that Kova ?
how old is he now ?
28 Deca Durabolin . -@ Phoebs .
after the creatures had attacked , he fell ill .
but then I treated him with quintessence .
No
he revealed the truth .
Quintessence is so much more than you understand .
-It is life itself .
-you have gone too far .
you coward .
Honerva , you ...
you want to prevent enlightenment .
we should increase passage .
with Voltron we facilitate access to the other reality .
that &apos;s insanity !
Quintessence poisoned your mind .
just the surface .
we can rule the universe ! - we can live forever !
we all !
-I do &apos;t want to be a part of this .
you are just a part of Voltron , Alfor .
do &apos;t hold us back for fear .
Alfor , I lead the Paladine !
you follow my orders !
Alfor !
Honerva ?
Honerva !
we must ...
we have to have it .
we have to have it . Come back .
-Come back .
-What is my beloved ?
Quintessence .
Quintessence is life .
transition .

we have to ... we have to ...
Voltron .
Voltron .
the only way .
Alfor tried to warn me , but I didn &apos;t hear it .
now my wife has become ill , and my planet is facing decay .
I besore you , my faithful companions , accompanies me on a dangerous mission .
we have to seal the transition . and Voltron must do that .
help you .
I hope it &apos;s not too late to save my planet and our friendship .
Alfor&apos;s compassion for his comrade blinhim blind to Zarkon &apos;s true plans .
According to Honerva , we can only the the transition with the power of the quintessence .
for this we must increase the opening first .
-how is this supposed to be done ?
-with the sword .
Make sword !
-This is too heavy .
-Concentrate yourself !
where are we ?
in transition .
No
Zarkon , what are you planning ?
-we have to take them away here !
-Fast .
creatures returned !
everywhere !
Laser !
Tri, , b her !
Gyrgan , Blaytz , tax missiles !
here !
Zarkon &apos;s attempt to save Honerva was in vain .
both succumbed to the radiation overload of the quintessence .
Zarkon had deceived the Paladine .
They had increased the transition , Dabilized Daibazaal .
King Alfor was forced to evacuate the planet .
he closed the transition in the only way he knew .
he destroyed the homeland of the Galra .
King Alfor organized a state funeral for Zarkon and Honerva .
but what happened there , he could never have imagined .
-Where am I ?
-on board your ship , sir .
home .
I can &apos;t , sir .
Daibazaal was destroyed .
my Galra . -@ Companions .
King Alfor of Altea destroyed our planet .
he will pay for his crimes .
join your Emperor !
Revenge will be ours !
Zarkon became evil par excellence , obsessed with quintessence .
for a new opening between the realities he needed Voltron .
and so the war began .
the Galra immediately their leader immediately and attacked .
The planets were not prepared .
soon they were all conquered . except for Altea .
in order not to drop Voltron fall into Ton &apos;s hands , the lions were sent to distant corners .
Zarkon was gry .
he killed King Alfor . He atatfied for the loss of Daibazaa with the destruction of Altea .
so this is Lotor &apos;s plan .
into other universes . -to get the purest quintessence .
-No matter how . We have to stop him .
my husband , how could I forget ?
you brought me back to life .
now I get you back .
since I know that I like to have Julia as a girlfriend , I want to look good whenever I see her .
so what important to girls . but looking good is hard .
Well , look at one .
the cam on the base .
I mean your hairstyle .
that makes no sense .
I have no cam ck-@ hairstyle .
Cocks do not even have hair .
They have a cockcomb of skin .
this &apos;s the red thing on her heads , isn &apos;t it ?
yes .
Hahnenkamm .
Funny word .
In terms of birds , chickens are not as cool as penguins , but they have interesting behaviors .
in natural environment , the rooster lures the hen to to ate by spreading his feathers and performing a dance .
God .
- Leave that .
I ride too much .
- Why so terrible ?
yes .
the lemon slices look very tasty .
Finger away . They are for the group .
everything clear .
fantastic .
it lowers a wing and dances around the female .
Shit , Casey .
a real man !
already fucked , or are you still stumbling ?
yes , of course .
Casey is totally rusting .
She has &apos;t even kissed a guy .
you told nothing about a friend .
why don you you telling me anything about it ?
he is not my friend , we just depend .
penis .
is that true ?
- Do you hang with his penis ?
- No , Sharice .
have u .
but encouraging girls to mmate or having them as a girlfriend requires other skills .
research is necessary .
you can &apos;t just ask a girl for a date .
you have to learn important things about them beforehand .
what is your favorite slimonade ?
the normal .
like movies ?
I love movies .
do you have fears or phobias ?
- No .
- What is your favorite @ winter sports ?
Well , we were snowsnowshoeing .
&quot; we , &quot; so you and your mom .
my friend .
Snowshoeing was his idea .
I hate the cold .
You have a friend ?
Miles
In any case , it is great that you are interest in others .
We have worked on that .
but let us come back to you .
So if Mr. Tavern &apos;s voice bothers you ...
when I was excited or stressed as a child , I hit my head somewhere or shamed out .
today I prefer replacement .
Sam
is everything fine ?
want you talk ?
I should talk to Mom .
so it usually works , but Mom is with the group today .
maybe I can help .
I like a girl .
honest ?
- Good .
how is it ?
- She is clever , and she is pretty .
and she has a friend , Miles .
Miles .
Well , that &apos;s crap .
but you know is not the end of the world .
Mom had one when I met her .
- ?
- This guy , Gerald Redenbach .
he had a jeep and a golden retriever . wearing a scarf .
She found him so cool .
and you strethim Mom ?
so in the art .

I was always close to her and was cute and charming .
- That worked ?
- Do the pudding sample .
- I don &apos;t like pudding .
- Forget the pudding .
the point is , you are young , Sam .
Relationships come and go .
She may have the friend this week and next week , who knows ?
you understand ?
yes .
I keep myself in case Miles leaves or dies .
or they are friendly .
- Okay , I do .
- You should .
- I think it went .
- I too .
we are always talking about taking time for ourselves . I have that .
I was at a dance course .
.
the teacher found I had talent .
really silly , but she said that .
and that &apos;s crazy , but afterwards we went to a bar , and I met a guy .
not as you think .
I am married .
you know Doug .
not really , he never comes . That &apos;s not his thing .
but whose thing is it ?
we don &apos;t come here for fun .
nothing against you .
I like you all .
Marjorie , you .
So , Sam ...
Sam is ... He had a good week .
but the thing is the , I was in the bar and probably for the first time since Sam &apos;s diagnosis I had no woror or afraid .
I just had fun with these strangers who have &apos;t to do with autism .
and again , I like you .
but this guy , this bartender is so ....
his life is so crazy and daring and normal . Do you know ?
and I realized that ...
Sam will never have such a life .

I don &apos;t know , I ...
I have made lemon slices . so calmcalmly .
there is a little too much lemon in it .
your dad is right .
Girls are free wild until a wedding ring is on their finger .
an engagement ring means she is ready for an mistake .
okay is perfect .
Watch careful .
sometimes I wish I would be as casual as Zahid .
of all I know , he is most successful with girls .
so you do that .
I hide , because the guy wants to kick in my ass , and he has a tattoo on my neck .
- How about you ?
Doug ?
- Oh , we went out .
a total disaster .
always when we have fun , I suess it .

you do it great .
it is noble that you remain with him , according to what he has done .
that &apos;s long ago .
how is Christopher since he ending ending regular school ?
he steps .
- He has tanges .
- Have you tried music therapy ?
I met this woman last year at auautism -@ Lauf , and I think I still have her card .
She has a real studio .
She has something from a punk rockcker , but she is for cuddly .

- Oh no .
What ?
my credit card .
- Lock .
- What &apos;s going going on ?
I have to block the Visa --@ card .
I forgot them after dancing in the bar .
- You want to wear the sweater ?
- What is not wrong with it ?
nothing , I just don &apos;t understand why you do so much sports if you don &apos;t see your great figure .

should I put on slutier ?
- Why block them ?
- Identity theft ?
that was a compliment .
you are wonderful under the monster .
Bye !
the bar is ten minutes away .
pick them up .
my To - -@ do . -@ list is already full enough .
we leave everything automatically .
we have to change that , ten more points points on the list .
- I get them .
it is on my way . - No .
do you know what ?
it was my mistake .
- I do .
- Sure ?
I &apos;m sorry that I was so snappy .
I don &apos;t hear it anymore .
Coach Briggs .
You wanted to talk to me ?
- Yes , come here .
&quot; Okay &quot; .
we have to talk .
when it comes to my suspension , I &apos;m really sorry .
really , the team is very important to me .
I would never do anything that harms him .
Gardner , take a look at this office .
my life is not great .
do you know what really enjoy happy besides my brother &apos;s failure ?
these are girls who have talent like you .
Taking you into the selection was risky .
- I do not want to regret that .
- No .
if I can do something to make it ...
- How ... - There is something .
you beat the daughter of our biggest sponsor .
Your parents always charter the bus for the semi-ials , this year year , unless you apologize to her .
?
She would have to apologize to Beth .
it &apos;s up to you .
your team will not be thrilled if there is no bus .
but don &apos;t worry .
Teens at -@ girls always always nicely and nicely with each other .
I should ouldn have beat you , no matter how nasty you were , and I &apos;m sorry .
your eye looks better , almost normal .
you are shit in the excuse .
yes , I know .
everything cool again ?
listen , I know your brother has big problems .
there lot a lot accumanger .
a stress ball .
I know you just apologize for getting the bus again .
from me .
you can have it .
but do not make big on the toilet .
Oh , and I heard you &apos;re with Evan Chapin .
that is fully courageous .
most are afraid to get with him , you not .
Bye .
- I need food .
- I hate the slut .
Slut ?
do you think it is promiscuous ?
No , she just annoys .
Do not take everything literally , idiot .
come to me when no one eats with you .
okay .
lessons begins .
you want to relax your woman ?
have your GPS ready , I will take you to Vaginahausen .
- This is not a real place .
- Yes , and I am the mayor .
Step one : be megacharmant .
Julia , Roald Amundsen has fed ssleed dogs dogs dogs his expedition expedition to Antarctica , so that it progresed faster .
- He made them cannibals .
What is your favourite ?
Step two : find out what annoannoher about her boyfriend .
but proceed subtly .
Julia , what are Miles &apos; three biggest weaknesses ?
You can also call more than three .
and step three , the most important of all :
chocolate strawberries .
makes girls sharp , and that is proven .
it would require empirical evidence .
for example their panties on the floor of my kitchenette .
this is anecdotal and pseudo-scientific .
get the damned berries .
cool shirt .
the Pharcyde .
I saw live in 1996 .
I was the whitest guy in the audience .
They are certainly the whitest everywhere .
- Five minutes five minutes .
- I just want to pick up a credit card .
&quot; Elsa Gardner &quot; .
that sounds like I &apos;m an ass , but I can only give it to the owner .

do you make an exception for one who wants to score with his wife ?
we were only driven .
it is not possible .

I will call them .
let her confirm it .
I understand .
Hey , Schatz .
what ?
I am in the bar to pick up your credit card .
tell the guy here .
Well , she tells you .
Hello , Nick here .

It was said he sold the band Meth , so it &apos;s so bad .

- Yes .

- Casey is only in the tenth .
- Yes , I forgot .
the superstar is still a baby .
baby

Which girls are you like ?
or do you want to pair ghtless birds ?

They think I don &apos;t realize when they laugh at me , but I do .
I just don &apos;t always know why , what somehow makes ow worse .

- Call you need me .

yes .
- Do you want to talk about it ?

I you said , I made a plan to steal a woman .
these were not exactly my words .
I just researched , and these guys laughed at me and asked questions , I don &apos;t know what was so funny .
They laughed more and more , and then Bailey ...
I am .
really .
I know .
some kids are assholes , Sam .
that is just the case .
but even the assholes get girlfriends .
everyone is easy , just I don &apos;t .
that is not true .
Believe me , it &apos;s hard for everyone .
not for you .
you have stretched ed Mom to the guy with the jeep .
I presented that too simple .
when your moom had got rid of the idiot , she let me flash flash ten times . okay ?
so it works .
but one must not give up .
so could I make a girl like me ?
of course .
then I need chocolate strawberries .
Hey , Mr. Freigeist .
climclimup up again ?
sorry .
I confused you .
I forgot my card here .
Elsa Gardner .
Gardner .

yes , that is my card .

yes , that &apos;s &apos;s why I was here , so ...
Sorry .
is Nick there ?
- Is Nick there ?
- It must be somewhere here .
all clear , you get out now and give the girl the strawberries .
then she is on the train .
you did what you could .
get them .
yes , that &apos;s why we are here .
No .
No , Sam .
Sam
No , Sam .
Sam
- What are you doing ?
- What do you mean ?
it is illegal to enter through windows .
I could not .
her boyfriend has funny working hours . She doesn &apos;t like it when you ring as he could sleep .
one of its rules .
rules .
things are clear .
before I do something , I want to know all the rules .
friend ?
which teenagers live together ?
Julia is not a teenager .
It is 26 years and three quarters .
Julia , your therapist ?
disappear .
come out .
we drive .
Let &apos;s go .
in the animal kingdom , the attraction is a simple , biological fact .
we have to get away .
only people make it complicated .
Wow is a great garden .
you could set up a pool .
Portable pools are cheap .
you can build a terrace around it , then it is almost like a real pool .
this &apos;s all I have to say about pools .
but ... Do you want to say something ?
okay .
why did you fly from school ?

that &apos;s you . Everyone tells something else .
what did you do ?
the car stolen by the director ?
- Manufactured in the in the laboratory ?
- No . - What happened then ?
- That doesn &apos;t matter matter .
is forever .
- For me , it plays a role .
- Why
I have enough trouble , and with you I could get it .
- Why don &apos;t you tell me ?
- It is stupid .
- Okay , go home .
- Come on .
I stolen a tuba .

I stolen a tuba .
and a trmbone .
and then some saxophones .
I broke into the rehearsal room and let a few instruments go .
I wanted to move them .
I had no good reason .
the rehearsal room was not completed .
That was the reason .
anyway , no matter .
90 minutes later the cops were with me and missed me handcued .
and since I stolen olen stuff stuff from my own school , I fw out .
that was .
that was . I hope you are satisfied .
is that your seriousness ?
you stolen musical instruments ?
- Did you do that ?
- I said it was stupid .
- Why gh ?
- Because this is shooting .
because everyone thinyou were a blatant dareevil .
- How did you dragged them away ?
- With my hand cart .
this is getting better and better .
I don &apos;t understand that you laughing at me .
I should not said .
- I have to pick up my sister .
- I didn &apos;t want to ...
- Evan , wait .
- What ?
I know .
I should go .
this &apos;s really unfavorable timing , but I ...
yes , you should .
- Yes .

- Yes .
the arrow was pointed and sharp .
one should think that there are rules that prohibit this in public .
they are dangerous dangerous , right ?

with you , alcoholic people fire weapons through the area .
that &apos;s dangerous , isn &apos;t it ?
- Yes ?
- I don &apos;t arrive ... - What ?
- Well , your top is in the way .
of course .
Then let &apos;s go .
okay .
I make wound ointment on it .
that has expired .
so what will not be bad .
yes , they have only so much space on these small tubes that they print ununnecessary information .
I never met anyone like you .
and that was .
you can dress .
exchange numbers .
if side effects of the expired ired intment occur .
listen to you should forget the matter with Julia .

On the one hand it is much older than you .
and if you tell her what you feel , it is a conflict of interest , she can no longer be your therapist .
- But I need her as a therapist .
then look for someone at your age .
a kind of practice friend before I date Julia .
I would not call that .
Before Roald Amundsen crossed the Antarctic , he has underon practice tours in simpler terrain .
this is only logical .
if I have enough experience with other girls , Julia becomes my girlfriend and is no longer my therapist .
or you could find a girl of your age .
that would be ideal for you .
and these girls will like you .
this is a good advice , thank you .
anytime .
Hey , Dad , will you tell Mom with Julia ?
- Do you want that ?
- No , thank you .
good , then that remains among us .
I don &apos;t want to state , but I had a really good day with Sam .
a good boy .
- What happened to your arm ?
- Nothing . That was a nail in the garage .
show him to me , then I beat him in .
- Did you do something ?
- Yes , wound ointment .
She had expired , but ...
the stuff doesn not really happen .
it only loses effect .
what is it for ?
because I &apos;m such a good dad ?
- Yes , you are Superdad .
- Yes ? - Do I get a cape with the title ?
- Not now .
the light .
human behavior is less less to that of a chicken than that of an albatros .
no matter how far he flies , he always returns home .
except , it flies too close over the water and is eaten by a tiger shark .
