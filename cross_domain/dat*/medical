Where is Yarvitan used ?
Yarvitan is used in adult dogs that are overweight or obese ( obese ) .

the drug is administered to the dog for 3 weeks , followed by a 2 -@ week drug break , during which the veterinarian adapts the dog &apos;s diet to his energy needs .
then the dog receives the drug for another 3 weeks in addition to the adapted diet .
the required dose is calculated on the weight of the dog , and the Yarvitan -@ solution is given to the animal with the food .
how does Yarvitan work ?
the medicinal active ingredient in Yarvitan , mitratapide , acts in the intestine by blocking a protein ( the microsomal triglyceride -@ transfer protein ) .
this protein is usually involved in the absorption of fats from food .
by blocking the protein , yarvitan reduces the absorption of fats from the intestine .
due to its mode of action , Yarvitan also has a slight appetite-suppresant effect .
how was Yarvitan investigated ?
Yarvitan was studied in dogs in both laboratory tests and in field studies .
two major field studies , one in Europe and one in the USA , were carried out on healthy dogs with a body weight that was 20 % higher than the recommended weight .

No interactions with other drugs were observed in studies in which Yarvitan was administered at the same time with NSAIDs ( carprofen , meloxicam ) or ACE -@ inhibitors ( enalapril , benazepril ) .
Interactions with other types of medicines have not been specifically investigated .
the absorption of fat-soluble drugs with simultaneous use with mitratapid was not investigated .
Therefore , dogs that receive other medicines should be tightly monitored with regard to drug interactions .
4.9 Dosage and method of use To enter .
the veterinary medicinal product is to be administered once a day at a dosage of 0.63 mg mitratapid / kg body weight ( equivalent to 1 ml of the drug per 8 kg ) .
To ensure the correct dosage , the dog should be weighed on day 1 and day 35 ( i.e. at the beginning of each treatment period ) .
the veterinary medicinal product should be administered together with the feed .
for administration , use the dosing pipette supplied with the drug for administration .
during the first 21 -@ day treatment , the amount of feed of the animal may remain unchanged .
then the dog should be fed according to its maintenance needs ( this is to be calculated by the veterinarian ) .
this can be achieved either with normal animal feed or with a diet food ( with a reduced amount of calories ) .
in clinical trials , the treated animals increased rapidly after the end of the treatment , if the diet was not restricted .
In order to avoid this rapid renewed weight gain ( rebound ) , restrictive feeding must be continued after maintenance must be continued after the end of treatment with the drug .
Therapy with Mitratrapid should be limited to one treatment procedure for a dog .
4.10 Overdose ( symptoms , emergency measures , antidotes ) , if necessary
after a 3 or 5 times overdose in dogs , the following symptoms were observed : soft or liquid stool , vomiting , salivation , anorexia , severe weight loss , emaciated appearance , dehydration and pale mucous membranes .
in case of accidental overdose , symptomatic therapy should be carried out .
there is no specific antidote .

QA08 AB90
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Mitratapid is a strong inhibitor of the microsomal triglyceride -@ transport protein ( MTP ) .
one assumes that
4 / 21 these effects are mediated by the MTP -@ inhibition at the enterocyte level .
this leads to the blocking of lipid uptake from the food .
Mitratapid also has a slightly appetite-cushioning effect , which is related to its mode of action .
as a result of the accumulation of triglycerides in the enterocytes .
Mitratapid has no central effect .
in clinical trials , the following percentage weight loss values were obtained in clinical trials :

5.2 Information on pharmacokinetics
Laboratory animals and dogs quickly absorb orally administered mitratapid .
the most important metabolic conversion is sulfoxidation , which produces three active metabolites .
5 l / kg .
Mitratapid and its metabolites bind to plasma proteins to a very large extent ( &gt; 99 % ) and are distributed in the tissues .
the brain is not affected , which is why a central effect of the veterinary medicinal product can be ruled out .
the excretion takes place quickly and predominantly via the feces .
8.5 hours ; the sulphone metabolite reaches 0.0092 µg / ml after 17.5 hours .
at the end of a three-week treatment period , mitratapid reaches average steady -@ state -@ concentrations of 0.0068 µg / ml , the sulfoxide -@ metabolites of 0.0089 µg / ml or
the terminal plasma half-life is 6.3 hours for mitratapid , 9.8 hours or
the pharmacokinetic parameters show a variable dose dependence , and vary slightly between the first and second three-week treatment periods of a complete treatment scheme .

What is Zactran ?
Zactran is an injection solution for cattle containing the active ingredient gamithromycin ( 150 mg / ml ) .
Where is Zactran used ?
Zactran is an antibiotic .
it is used to treat and prevent respiratory diseases in cattle ( Bovine Respiratory Disease , BRD ) , which are caused by the bacteria Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni .
before the use of Zactran to prevent Germany , the occurrence of the disease in the herd should have been proven .
Zactran is administered as a unique subcutaneous injection ( injected under the skin ) .
the dose to be applied is calculated based on the weight of the animal to be treated .
Animals weighing over 250 kg must administer the injection in more than one place .
how does Zactran work ?
the active ingredient of Zactran , gamithromycin , is an antibiotic from the group of macrolides .
it works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes , i.e. the parts of the cells in which proteins are produced , and thus inhibits the growth of the bacteria .
how was Zactran investigated ?
Appropriate studies have been carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of zactran in cattle .
The main clinical trials have been carried out on farms in a number of countries in Europe and outside the EU .
the effect of Zactran on the treatment of Federal Republic of Germany was investigated compared to another macrolide -@ antibiotic ( tulathromycin ) on cattle already approved in the EU .
the effect of Zactran on the prevention of Germany was investigated compared to a placebo ( sham drug ) on cattle in the same farm with

what benefit has Zactran shown in these studies ?
Zactran has been shown to be effective in the treatment and prevention of Germany caused by Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni .
Zactran has proven to be as effective in the treatment of Germany , Zactran has proven to be as effective in the treatment of Germany as tulathromycin .
what is the risk associated with Zactran ?
after the injection of zactran , up to 45 % of the animals swelling at the injection site in up to 45 % of the animals .
The animals may also show signs of mild pain for a day .
Swelling generally regedes within 3 to 14 days , but can persist in some animals up to 35 days after treatment .
what precautions must be taken by people who administer the drug or come into contact with the animal ?
Persons with known hypersensitivity ( allergy ) to similar antibiotics ( from the group of macrolides ) should avoid contact with Zactran .
Zactran can cause irritation of the eyes or skin .
therefore , contact with skin or eyes should be avoided .
if Zactran comes into direct contact with the eyes , they are immediately rinsed out with clear water .
with direct skin contact , the affected area should also be washed off immediately with clear water .
in case of accidental self-injection , a doctor should be consulted and shown the package leaflet or label .
how long must it necessary to wait until the slaughter of the beast and the consumption of the meat by man ( waiting time ) ?
the animals may only be slaughtered until 64 days after the last administration of Zactran .
how long must it necessary to wait until the animal &apos;s milk can be used for human consumption ?
since the safety of Zactran in breeding animals has not been investigated , the drug may not be used for lactating cows or heifers whose milk is intended for human consumption .
it may also not be used to pregnant cows or heifers whose milk is intended for human consumption , in the last two months before the date of birth .
Why was Zactran approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of zactran in the therapeutic and preventive treatment of respiratory diseases in cattle ( FRG ) , which are caused by Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni ( provided that the occurrence of the disease in the herd ) outweigh the risks , and recommended that the authorisation for the placing on the market of Zactran .

pharmacological PROPERACTERISTICS
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Macrolide antibiotics , ATCvet -@ Code :
QJ01FA95
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Gamithromycin is an azalid from the group of semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotics , consisting of a 15 -@ C lactone ring with a characteristic alkylated nitrogen atom at position 7A .
this special chemical structure allows the rapid absorption at physiological pH -@ value and the long duration of action in the target tissue lungs .
Macrolide antibiotics have both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect , as they interrupt bacterial protein synthesis by bying to the ribosomal 50S -@ subunit and thus prevent the prolongation of the peptide chain .
in favorites -@ vitro -@ Data prove that gamithromycin is bactericidal effect .
these pathogenic germs are most commonly involved in the Federal Republic of Germany .
the following MHK and MBK -@ data come from representative samples of field dissolates within various geographical regions of the EU .

Three mechanisms are blamed for resistance to macrolide antibiotics , also known as MLSB -@ resistance , as it affects macrolide antibiotics , Lincosamides and streptogramins in the same way .
These include the change of the ribosomal binding site , the use of active efflux mechanisms and the production of inactivating enzymes .
5.2 Information on pharmacokinetics
Gamithromycin a dosage of 6 mg / kg body weight is rapidly absorbed in the neck of the cattle after a single subcutaneous injection .
maximum plasma concentrations are achieved after 30 to 60 minutes .
the plasma -@ half-life is more than 2 days .
in the lungs maximum concentrations are reached after less than 24 hours at a lung -@ plasma -@ ratio of &gt; 264 .

ZUBRIN
Summary of the EPAR for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary ( CVMP ) assesses the documents submitted in order to make recommendations on the use of the veterinary medicinal product .
this document cannot replace the personal conversation with the veterinarian .
If you need more information about the medical condition or treatment of your pet , please contact your veterinarian .
For more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( which is also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Zubrin ?
Zubrin is a lyophilisate for use , i.e. a kind of tablet that quickly disintegrates after contact with moisture , e.g. when placed on the dog &apos;s tongue .
Zubrin contains the effective ingredient tepoxalin .
What is Zubrin used ?
Zubrin is used in dogs against inflammation and to relieve pain in acute and chronic diseases of the musculoskeletal system .
Zubrin is given to the dog once a day about 1 -@ 2 hours after feeding , until the animal is better again .
However , as side effects may occur , any treatment should be carried out for more than 1 - 2 weeks under regular veterinary control .
how does Zubrin work ?
Zubrin contains tepoxaline , which belongs to the drug class of so-called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID ) .
Zubrin acts by blocking the enzymes cyclooxygenase -@ 1 and cyclooxygenase -@ 2 .
when these enzymes are blocked , less prostaglandin is formed .
since the prostaglandins are substances that cause inflammation , tepoxaline reduces inflammation and swelling of muscles or joints and the associated pain .

Zubrin was studied in laboratory animals and diseased dogs in various veterinary practices / clinics in the USA and a number of countries in Europe ( &quot; clinical trials &quot; ) .
In these clinical studies , the animal owners administered their dogs ubrin once a day at a dose of 10 mg per kg of the dog &apos;s body weight with or without food .
the best results were achieved when Zubrin was administered 1 - 2 hours after feeding .
However , as side effects may occur , any treatment should be carried out for more than 1 - 2 weeks under regular veterinary control .
Zubrin was just as effective as other drugs of the same class and led to a significant improvement in dogs with muscle or joint problems .
What are the side effects of Zubrin ?
the side effects of Zubrin are those that can also be observed in other NSAIDs , such as
Vomiting , soft feces or diarrhea , blood in the feces , reduced appetite and dulatiness .
Vomiting or diarrhea was observed in one in ten dogs .
Occasionally , hair loss or redness of the skin .
if such adverse effects can be observed in your dog , you should not administer Zubrin .
Furthermore , if your dog receives further medication , you should inform the veterinarian before starting treatment with Zubrin before starting treatment , as some medications can influence each other in their effectiveness .
what precautions must be taken by people who administer the drug or who come into contact with the animal ?
Zubrin has a special dosage form ( lyophilisate ) , which can quickly dissolves quickly upon contact with moisture and can become slippery or sticky when held in the hand .
Therefore , you should make sure that you administer the medication with dry hands .
IF the lyophilisate dissolves prematurely in the hand , wash your hands thoroughly .
Zubrin should be put right in the mouth , and you should try to keep the dog &apos;s catch closed for a moment .
Zubrin must not be used in humans .
IF someone accidentally takes some tablets , a doctor should be consulted immediately .
Why was Zubrin approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of zrine in the treatment of inflammation or pain in muscles or joints in dogs outweigh the risks , and recommended that the authorisation for the placing on the market of Zubrin .
the benefit -@ risk -@ ratio can be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

pharmacological PROPERACTERISTICS
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
not included -@ steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ATCvet -@ Code :
QM01AE92
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
tepoxaline is a double cyclooxygenase and 5 -@ lipoxygenase -@ inhibitor with anti-inflammatory effect .
the oral administration of 10 mg tepoxaline / kg body weight leads to an inhibition of prostaglandin and leukotriene -@ synthesis .
5.2 Information on pharmacokinetics
2 hours ) .
after administration of a therapeutic dose of 10 mg / kg , the Cmax of tepoxalin fed dogs was 1.08 ± 0.37 µg / ml ( low-fat feed ) and 1.19 ± 0.29 µg / ml ( high-fat feed ) .
the absorption of tepoxaline is favoured by administration to fed dogs .
tepoxalin is significantly converted into its acid metabolites .
the acid metabolite is a highly effective cyclooxygenase -@ inhibitor and prolongs the efficacy of the parent substance .
in dogs , the plasma concentrations of the acid metabolite are higher than those of the mother substance .
after repeated administration over a wide dose range , no accumulation of tepoxaline or its acid metabolite was detected .
tepoxalin and its metabolites are highly bound to proteins , i.e. more than 98 % bound to proteins .
tepoxalin and its metabolites are excreted via the feces ( 99 % ) .
