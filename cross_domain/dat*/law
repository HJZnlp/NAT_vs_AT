3 . Normal value
3.1 Determination of the normal value for all executing manufacturers without MWB
a ) Comparison country
35 . Pursuant to Article 2 ( 7 ) of the Basic Regulation , the normal value in the case of imports from countries without a market economy and , if no MWB cannot be granted , the normal value must be determined from countries referred to in Article 2 ( 7 ) ( b ) of the Basic Regulation on the basis of the price or the mathematical value in a comparative country .
( 36 ) In the announcement of the initiation of the proceedings , the Commission had proposed Turkey as an appropriate comparative country for determining the normal value for the People &apos;s Republic of China and invited the interested parties to submit an opinion on this matter .
( 37 ) Some interested parties objected to this proposal .
the main arguments they put forward against Turkey were :
- lack of competition on the Turkish domestic market ( there are only three manufacturers in Turkey ) ;
- production in Turkey corresponds to 1.3 % of Chinese production ;
- the cost structure of Chinese manufacturers differs from that of the Turkish manufacturers , in particular in terms of labour and raw material costs ;
- the economic and cultural relations of the People &amp; Republic of China and those of Turkey and the EU are different because Turkey is closer to Europe , benefiting from a customs union with the EU since 1995 and harmonising its legislation in the light of the negotiations on Turkey &apos;s accession to the EU to the EU -@ standards ;
- the Turkish currency lost sharply in value ; some Turkish manufacturers are associated with applicants ;
- the quality of Turkish goods is too low .
( 38 ) The interested parties proposed India or Russia as suitable comparative countries .
( 39 ) The Commission sought to cooperate from other potential comparative countries such as Russia , India , Japan , South Korea , the United States of America , Serbia and Montenegro and South Africa .
Of the 38 companies around the world with which she contacted , only two companies in the US agreed to participate .
( 40 ) The analysis of the available information showed that there is competition in the US -@ American market for the affected goods with at least three manufacturers , around 30 suppliers , more than 15 importers and around 300 users .
According to the results of the investigation , as mentioned in recital 14 , the affected goods and the Magnesia -@ stones manufactured in the People &apos;s Republic of China or the USA and sold on the domestic markets were similar .
In addition , the study found that more than 50 % of the raw materials used by one of the US -@ American manufacturers were imported from the People &apos;s Republic of China and that the manufacturing processes in the two countries did not differ significantly .
( 41 ) This provisionally concludes that the United States of America was the most appropriate and representative comparative country within the meaning of Article 2 ( 7 ) of the Basic Regulation .
b ) Determination of the normal value
( 42 ) Pursuant to Article 2 ( 7 ) ( a ) of the Basic Ordinance , the normal value for those manufacturers who have not been granted MWB was determined on the basis of the manufacturer &apos;s verified data in the comparative country .
Since the sales of the US -@ American manufacturers were , according to the results of the investigation , transactions in normal trade , the normal value for the types of goods , which were comparable to the types of goods exported from the Republic of China to the Community was determined on the basis of the prices paid or paid on the US -@ American domestic market .
( 43 ) The normal value was the weighed average domestic selling price paid by the cooperating US -@ American manufacturers to independent customers for product types with a comparable MgO -@ content .
if necessary , corrections have been made for the different treatments of the different types of goods .
3.2 Determination of the normal value for the implementing manufacturers to whom an MWB has been granted
( 44 ) It should be recalled that the dumping margin for the companies to which an MWB was granted was determined on the basis of their information on domestic sales and the production costs for the goods concerned .
this data has been checked in the operations of the companies concerned .
( 45 ) In order to determine the normal value , the Commission first examined for each cooperating implementing manufacturer whether the entire domestic sales of the goods concerned were representative compared to the entire export sales to the Community .
in accordance with Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation , domestic sales were considered representative if the total volume of these sales of each exporting manufacturer corresponded to at least 5 % of the total amount of the manufacturer &amp; apos ; s export sales to the Community .
( 46 ) On this basis , it was established that the domestic sales of the affected goods of an exporting manufacturer in the UZ were representative .
the domestic sales of the affected goods of the other executive manufacturer in the UZ were not representative .
( 47 ) For the implementing manufacturer with representative domestic sales , the Commission then identified the types of goods sold on the domestic market , which were identical or directly comparable to the types sold for export to the Community .
( 48 ) For each type sold on the domestic market which , according to the results of the investigation , was directly comparable to a type sold for export to the Community , it was examined whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative within the meaning of Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation were sufficiently representative .
Domestic sales of a particular type of goods were considered sufficiently representative if the total volume of domestic sales of this type in the UZ corresponded to 5 % or more of the total volume of export sales of the comparable type of goods to the Community .
( 49 ) This analysis showed that the executive manufacturer with total representative sales did not sell all types of goods in Germany in representative quantities .
( 50 ) The Commission then examined whether domestic sales of the individual types of goods sold in representative quantities on the domestic market could be regarded as transactions in normal trade , each determining the share of profitable sales to independent customers was determined .
( 51 ) Domestic sales were considered profitable if the unit price of the respective type of goods corresponded to at least to the production costs .
therefore , the production costs were determined for each type of goods sold in the UZ on the domestic market .
( 52 ) As mentioned in recitals 50 and 51 , the share of profitable sales of the type of goods in question to independent customers on the domestic market was determined .
In cases where the sales quantity of a type sold at a net selling price in the amount of the mathematical production costs or above was 80 % or more of the total selling volume of that type and where the weighted average price of the type in question corresponded to at least to the production costs , the normal value was based on the actual domestic price determined as the balanced average of the prices of all domestic sales made in the UZ , regardless of whether these sales were profitable or not .
In cases where the volume of profitable sales of a type accounted for less than 80 % of the total sales volume of the type in question or where the weighted average price of the type in question was below the production costs , the normal value was based on the actual domestic price , which was determined as the balanced average of only the profitable sales , provided that the volume of these sales amounted to 10 % or more of the total sales volume of the type in question .
( 53 ) If the profitable sales for a type assumed less than 10 % of the total sales volume , the view was held that the sales volumes of this type were not sufficient to be able to use the domestic price as an appropriate basis for determining the normal value .
( 54 ) The above analysis showed that certain types of goods were sold in normal trade .
( 55 ) For all types of goods which were either not sold in representative quantities or - due to the invoiced prices - not in normal trade ( see recitals 52 and 53 ) , the domestic prices of the manufacturer in question could not be used to determine the normal value , so that another method had to be used .
( 56 ) In cases where the domestic prices of a certain type sold by an implementing manufacturer could not be used , the normal value had to be determined on the basis of the costs of the manufacturer in question .
the normal value was calculated in accordance with Article 2 ( 3 ) of the Basic Regulation by adding a reasonable amount for the selling , administrative and overhead costs ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; VG -@ Costs &quot; ) and an reasonable profit margin .
To this end , the Commission examined whether the VG -@ costs and the profits made by the company in Germany were reliable .
( 57 ) The actual VG -@ costs were considered reliable if the total volume of domestic sales of the company concerned could be considered representative compared to the volume of export sales to the Community .
the domestic profit margin was determined on the basis of the domestic sales of the types sold in normal trade .
this was done on the basis of the method set out in recitals 45 , 48 , 52 and 53 .
for a company , the actually recorded VG -@ costs and profits could be used because it met the aforementioned criteria .
( 58 ) For the other company whose domestic sales were not representative , the normal value was determined in accordance with Article 2 ( 6 ) ( c ) of the Basic Regulation .
According to the investigation results , the cost structure of the other company with MWB and representative domestic sales for only a few types of goods showed such deviations that it was not a justifiable basis for determining the normal value .
However , according to the investigation , the costs of the company , whose domestic sales were not representative , were reliable , so that the normal value was determined on the basis of the data of the company , which corresponded to that of the other exporters / manufacturers of the same goods in that country of origin .
4 . Export prices
( 59 ) All export sales to the community of exporters with MWB or IT were conducted either through affiliated importers in the Community , affiliated importers outside the Community or through companies that were not associated with the executive manufacturers but worked closely with them or even had the exclusive distribution rights .
in cases where exports were sold through affiliates , export prices have been calculated in accordance with Article 2 ( 9 ) of the Basic Regulation .
in all cases where exports of the goods concerned went to independent customers in the Community , the export price was calculated in accordance with Article 2 ( 8 ) of the Basic Regulation was calculated on the basis of the export prices actually paid or paid in accordance with Article 2 ( 8 ) of the basic Regulation .
( 60 ) In accordance with Article 2 ( 9 ) of the Basic Regulation , corrections have been made to all costs incurred by the importer between import and resale , including VG -@ costs and an reasonable profit margin .
in this case , the profit margin actually recorded by the cooperating independent importers was seen as a justifiable basis .
5 . Comparison
( 61 ) The normal value and export prices were compared with each other at the factory level and at the same trading level .
in the interest of a fair comparison , corrections for differences were made on request in accordance with Article 2 ( 10 ) of the basic regulation , which demonstrably influenced the prices and comparability of prices .
( 62 ) These corrections concerned differences in transport , insurance , provision , loading and ancillary costs , borrowing costs , commissions , import duties and customer service costs ( guarantee ) .
6 . Dumping span
6.1 Cooperating implementing manufacturers to whom an MWB / IB was granted
( 63 ) In the case of the two companies to which an MWB was granted , the weighted average normal value of the individual types of goods exported to the Community was compared with the weighted average export price of the corresponding type in accordance with Article 2 ( 11 ) of the basic Regulation .
( 64 ) In the case of the four undertakings to which an IB was granted , in accordance with Article 2 ( 11 ) of the Basic Regulation , the weighted average normal value of the individual types of goods exported to the Community was compared with the weighted average export price of the corresponding type .
( 65 ) The provisional average dumping margins , expressed as a percentage of the cif -@ prices free limit of the Community , unpaid , reach the following values :
- Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 11.2 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 34,1 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Guangyang Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 55.7 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Kyushu Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 55.7 % _ BAR _
- Dashiqiao Sanqiang Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 99,9 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Qinghua Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 41.4 % . _ BAR _
6.2 For all other executing manufacturers
( 66 ) In order to calculate the dumping margin for all other exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China , the Commission first determined the scope of the cooperation .
To this end , she compared the total imports of the affected China on the basis of the Eurostat -@ statistics according to the total imports of the affected goods originating in the People &apos;s Republic , with the answers of the cooperating exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China to the questionnaire .
after that the cooperation was low .
( 67 ) In view of the low participation , the dumping margin for all other exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China in the amount of the highest dumping margin determined for the cooperating executive manufacturers , namely 99.9 % of the cif -@ price free border of the Community , was unpaid .
However , the nationwide dumping range was higher than the residual damage range .
C. CLOISGATION
1 . Joint production
( 68 ) In this study it was found that magnesia -@ stones were made by :
- two applicant Community producers and two other manufacturers who worked fully with the Commission during the investigation ( RHI , LWB , Refractarios Burceña S.L. and Ceramica del Nalon S.A. ) ;
- a manufacturer who answered the questionnaire in detail , but spoke out against the procedure ( Refratechnik ) ;
- seven other manufacturers and Assopiatrelle ( the Italian association of the refractory -@ Industry , which represents a production of 64000 tonnes ) , which supported the Community industry but did not answer the questionnaire in detail .
another manufacturer sent a letter , but did not agree nor opposed .
2 . Definition of the Community industry
2.1 Manufacturers or manufacturers associated with the People &apos;s Republic of China who import the affected goods from the People &apos;s Republic of China
( 69 ) The investigation revealed that two of the cooperating manufacturers in the Community , namely RHI and Refratechnik , also imported the affected goods from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
For this reason , it was examined whether these undertakings should be excluded from the Community industry in accordance with Article 4 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the basic Regulation .
2.1.1 RHI
( 70 ) RHI produces in the Community , but also introduces the affected goods but also by an affiliated Joint -@ Venture -@ company in the People &apos;s Republic of China , RHI Liaoning .
it was found that in the UZ the majority of RHI &apos;s community sales were made in the community and only a small proportion came from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
this share is low , because the Chinese production of RHI is primarily intended for the rapidly growing Asian market .
RHI is also the largest producer in the community , and its headquarters , the R &amp; D Centre and the largest production facilities are located in the Community .
For this reason , it was established that the core business of RHI with the goods concerned is located in the Community .
( 71 ) It was then examined the impact of the sale of the imported goods on the total sales of the company in the Community .
the investigation found that RHI had no significant profitability benefits from the resale of imports .
this resulted in a comparison of the profitability of the cooperating community manufacturers .
( 72 ) In view of the low share of imports and the fact that these imports did not have a significant positive impact on the profitability of Community sales as a whole , this company was not immune from the negative effects of the damaging dumping .
for this reason , the view is taken that it would not be justified to exclude RHI from the Community industry .
2.1.2 Refratechnik
( 73 ) Refratechnik also produces the affected goods in the community and introduces them from manufacturers in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
The investigation found that almost half of the company &apos;s joint sales were manufactured in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
It was also noted that the expansion of business was largely made possible by an increase in imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
For this reason , it was believed that the core business of Refratechnik is located not only in the community , but also in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
( 74 ) Subsequently , it was examined how the sales introduced affected the Company &amp; apos ; s total sales in the Community .
the investigation revealed that , in contrast to RHI , Refratechnik had considerable benefit from the resale of imports .
( 75 ) In view of the high proportion of imports in the total volume of sales in the Community , as well as the fact that the core business appears to be gradually transferred to the People &apos;s Republic of China and that Refratechnik clearly had a benefit from the dumped imports , it was held that Refratechnik should be excluded from the Community industry in accordance with Article 4 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the basic regulation and should be regarded as a &apos; other market participant &apos; .
2.2 Community industry
( 76 ) The production of the four Community producers who worked fully in the investigation , including RHI and without retreat technology , amounted to 233732 tonnes during the period under investigation , accounting for 53 % of the total Community production , thus forming the Community industry within the meaning of Articles 4 ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) ( 4 ) of the basic regulation .
( 77 ) The investigation revealed no own consumption of the affected goods for the Magnesia -@ bricks producing industry .
some steel companies , on the other hand , produced Magnesia -@ bricks for self-consumption .
However , this quantity was low compared to the production volumes of the refractory -@ industry in the Community .
since this production is intended for self-consumption in the steel industry and none of the companies in the steel industry worked as a manufacturer of Magnesia -@ stones ( although many of them received questionnaires ) , this part of the production seems to have no significant impact on the Community industry .
( 78 ) As the Community industry consisted of four companies and two of these companies accounted for around 2 % of the volume of production , the following disclosures for the Community industry was indexed for reasons of confidentiality .
3 . Community consumption
( 79 ) Consumption was determined on the basis of estimates from the sector of the economy , which the Community industry transmitted according to the usual practice .
The calculation of this data was based on steel production ( source : relevant reports from the International Iron and Steel Institute - IISI ) , divided by the amount of the affected goods required to produce a tonne of steel .
( 80 ) The import quantities were determined on the basis of the Eurostat -@ data for the relevant KN -@ codes ( 68159100 , 68159910 , 68151010 , 68159990 , 69021000 and 69039020 ) .
Deductions were made from the quantities determined were deducted for those goods which , in view of their price , were clearly not the goods concerned in view of their price .
The net volumes resulting after deduction ( 73291 tonnes for all countries and 59831 tonnes for the People &apos;s Republic of China ) were compared with the import volumes ( around 42,000 tonnes ) reported by the cooperating manufacturers in the People &apos;s Republic of China ( around 42,000 tonnes ) indicated by the cooperating manufacturers in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
in view of the fact that some 13500 tonnes were imported from countries other than the People &apos;s Republic of China , ii according to the importers and users in the Community , the goods concerned were also imported by non-cooperating exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China and in iii many other exporting manufacturers in the People &apos;s Republic of China questionnaires , but did not cooperate , it was held that the Eurostat -@ statistics correctly record the import volumes .
Furthermore , it was reported in a Chinese press release ( China Metallurgical News , January 4 , 2004 ) it was reported that in 2003 80,000 tons were exported to Europe in 2003 , which suggests that the aforementioned Eurostat -@ number is by no means too high for the UZ ( 59831 ) .
( 81 ) The sales of the Community industry on the Community market were identified on the basis of the verified responses of the five cooperating Community producers ( including Refratechnik ) to the questionnaire .
the remaining volumes ( i.e. consumption minus imports minus sales of the Community industry ) were considered sales of non-cooperating Community producers .
( 82 ) The consumption determined in this way , the development of which is shown in the following table , shows that the demand for the goods concerned in the Community was practically constant during the reference period .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Community consumption _ BAR _ 399563 _ BAR _ 397203 _ BAR _ 401499 _ BAR _ 400638 _ BAR _
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 99 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _
4 . Imports from the country concerned into the Community
4.1 Market share of imports concerned
( 83 ) The quantities and market share of imports from the country concerned developed as follows :
Import quantities _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
PR China _ BAR _ 23980 _ BAR _ 44542 _ BAR _ 54181 _ BAR _ 59831 _ BAR _
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 186 _ BAR _ 226 _ BAR _ 250 _ BAR _
Market share of imports _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
PR China _ BAR _ 6.0 % _ BAR _ 11.2 % _ BAR _ 13.5 % _ BAR _ 14.9 % _ BAR _
( 84 ) While the consumption of Magnesia -@ stones remained constant in the reference period , imports from the country concerned increased by around 150 % in the same period .
As a result , the market share of the People &apos;s Republic of China increased from 6.0 % to 14.9 % to more than double in the reference period .
4.2 Prices of imports and price undercuts
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Prices of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China ( Source : Eurostat ) _ BAR _ 686 _ BAR _ 601 _ BAR _ 560 _ BAR _ 533 _ BAR _
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 88 _ BAR _ 82 _ BAR _ 78 _ BAR _
( 85 ) The table above shows the development of the average prices of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
prices fell by 22 % in the reference period .
( 86 ) The prices charged by the Community industry and the implementing manufacturers in the country concerned in the UZ on the Community market have been compared .
The prices were compared after deduction of all discounts and volume discounts .
the prices of the Community industry were brought to the level , and import prices were based on the cif -@ prices free border of the Community .
( 87 ) The comparison showed that imports of the goods concerned were sold in the UZ were sold in the Community at prices which were 16.6 % below the prices of the Community industry ( expressed as a percentage of the prices of the Community industry ) .
in view of this price undercut range and the described development of the prices of the Community industry , it is clear that prices had already been significantly reduced .
5 . Situation of the Community industry
( 88 ) In accordance with Article 3 ( 5 ) of the Basic Regulation , the examination of the impact of dumped imports on the Community industry comprised an assessment of all economic factors and indices affecting the situation of the Community industry from 2001 ( base year ) to the UZ .
( 89 ) The following information on the Community industry are the aggregate data of the four cooperating Community producers .
5.1 Production , production capacity and capacity utilization
( 90 ) Production , production capacity and capacity utilization developed as follows :
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Production ( in tonnes ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 88 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _ 91 _ BAR _
Production capacity ( in tonnes ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 90 _ BAR _ 84 _ BAR _ 84 _ BAR _
Capacity utilization ( in % ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 106 _ BAR _ 108 _ BAR _
( 91 ) As the table above shows , production decreased by 9 % in the reference period .
to save costs , production capacity was reduced by 16 % , leading to an 8 % increase in capacity utilization .
5.2 Inventories
( 92 ) The table below shows the inventories of the annual financial statements .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Inventories ( in tonnes ) _ BAR _ BAR _ BAR _ BAR _ BAR _
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 109 _ BAR _ 105 _ BAR _ 108 _ BAR _
( 93 ) Inventories increased by 8 % in the reference area .
the Community industry usually produces the affected goods on order .
The level of inventories was therefore not found to be particularly meaningful for the assessment of the situation of the Community industry .
5.3 Sales volume , market share , growth and average unit prices in the Community
( 94 ) The table below shows the sales of the Community industry to independent customers in the Community .
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Sales quantity ( in tonnes ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 97 _ BAR _ 99 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _
Market share _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 97 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _
Average selling price ( EUR / ton ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _ 89 _ BAR _
( 95 ) The sales volumes and market share of the Community industry were constant during the reference period .
However , given the push of dumped imports into the Community market , this could only be achieved by reducing the average selling prices by 11 % .
( 96 ) However , the 11 % decline in average prices does not significantly reflect the decline in prices in key market segments .
In the steel industry , the affected goods are mainly used to build three types of vessels ( pans , converters and electric arc furnaces ) .
At first , imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China consisted mainly of ladle stones from the lower market segment .
in the reference period , however , there was a trend towards the penetration of the higher segments of the converters and electric arc furnaces .
Converters and electric arc furnaces must achieve a maximum service life , which means that more expensive stones of high quality must be used to increase the number of furnace travel before renewing the lining .
an analysis of the sales structure during the reference period showed that the Community &amp; apos ; s industry was focused towards lower volumes for the high-quality market segments in order to defend itself against the pressure of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
this development shows that the average prices of some product types decreased by more than 11 % .
For example , the average price of the largest product group ( stones with 9 % residual carbon and mting magnesia ) fell by 19 % in the reference period .
( 97 ) In view of the increase in imports , the Community industry has not grow despite a reduction in its average prices .
Rather , he was forced to reduce production capacity and jobs .
5.4 Profitability
( 98 ) The profitability shown in the table below was calculated as the return on sales of sales on the Community market .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Profitability of community sales _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 76 _ BAR _ 26 _ BAR _ 45 _ BAR _
( 99 ) Profitability declined significantly between 2001 and 2003 as a result of price reductions , which coincided with the increase in dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
in the UZ , profitability increased slightly again , which was mainly due to a reduction in costs .
Although the Community industry made profits in the UZ , the profit margin was significantly lower than would normally be expected in the absence of dumped imports .
As the table shows , profitability was much higher in 2001 , when the market share of dumped imports was still relatively low , was much higher as expected .
5.5 Return on investment ( RoI ) , cash flow , investments and capital raising opportunities
( 100 ) The table below provides an overview of the development of return on investment , cash flow and investments .
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Return on investment ( RoI ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 85 _ BAR _ 50 _ BAR _ 52 _ BAR _
Cash flow _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 81 _ BAR _ 55 _ BAR _ 60 _ BAR _
Investments _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 75 _ BAR _ 131 _ BAR _ 134 _ BAR _
( 101 ) The table shows that the return on investment has developed broadly in parallel with the return on sales ( see above ) .
Cash flow follows roughly the same trend , i.e. it declined slightly in the UZ .
The decline in return on investment and cash flow reflects the fact that the average selling prices fell faster than the average cost of the goods sold .
( 102 ) The Community industry has increased its investment .
they were mainly used to renew existing plants and machines , less to set up new production facilities .
( 103 ) However , the possibilities of the Community &amp; apos ; s capital raising from credit institutions or parent companies were not seriously affected during the reference period because companies belong to larger corporations .
The capital raising opportunities are therefore primarily dependent on the strength of the Group and not necessarily on the circumstances in the business concerned .
this factor should therefore be irrelevant to this investigation .
5.6 Employment , productivity and wages
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Number of employees _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 91 _ BAR _ 92 _ BAR _ 93 _ BAR _
Productivity ( ton / employees ) _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 96 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _ 98 _ BAR _
Wages _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 84 _ BAR _ 82 _ BAR _ 82 _ BAR _
( 104 ) As can be seen from the table , the Community industry reduced the number of its employees from 2001 to the UZ .
the increase between 2003 and the UZ can be explained by an increase in production .
Productivity was largely constant in the reference period .
( 105 ) Wages fell significantly in 2002 , but then remained constant until the UZ .
The reason for this was a restructuring programme that year , as the above-mentioned development of production and employment described above shows .
5.7 Height of the actual dumping margin
( 106 ) The dumping ranges are listed in the section on dumping .
they are clearly above the low threshold .
Moreover , the impact of the actual dumping margin cannot be considered irsignificant , given the volume and prices of dumped imports .
5.8 Effects of previous dumping or subsidy practices
( 107 ) The Community industry has not recovered from the effects of previous dumping or subsidy practices , as no investigations have yet been carried out .
5.9 Conclusion on damage
( 108 ) While the sales volumes and market share in the Community remained relatively constant , the Community industry was confronted with a 11 % fall in the average prices of 11 % in the reference period , although it changed its product -@ Mix in favour of higher-value types of goods .
Notwithstanding the cost savings , the profit margin decreased noticeably , so that the profits in the UZ were 55 % below the 2001 level , significantly below the level that would have been expected without dumped imports .
( 109 ) The deterioration in the situation of the Community industry during the reference period is also reflected in the reduction in production and production capacity , the decline in wages , employment , return on investment and cash flow , and a lack of growth despite a 11 % reduction in average prices .
( 110 ) These negative developments fell at a period of relatively constant productivity , increasing investment and better capacity utilization .
The development of inventories and capital raising opportunities was not considered meaningful for the reasons set out above .
( 111 ) Taking into account all these indicators , it is provisionally concluded that the Community industry in the UZ has been caused to significant damage within the meaning of Article 3 of the Basic Regulation .
d . SCHADENSURSACHE
1 . Preliminary remark
( 112 ) It was also examined whether there was a causal link between the dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China and the damage to the Community industry .
Factors other than dumped imports , which may have harmed the Community industry at the same time to ensure that any damage caused by these other factors was not attributed to dumped imports .
2 . Effects of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China
( 113 ) As already shown above , the volume of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China increased by around 150 % in the reference period and their market share by 118 % during the reference period .
As set out in recital 85 , the prices of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China also declined by 22 % and a significant price cut was found ( see recital 86 ) .
In response to imports , the Community industry retained its sales volume ( in order not to jeopardise the economies of scale ) , but had to significantly reduce its prices .
Among other things , this price reduction led , among other things , to a 55 % decline in profitability .
Thus , the profitability is significantly lower than expected in this type of industry ; this level is no longer sustainable .
3 . Effects of imports from third countries
Index 2001 = 100 _ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Imports from countries other than the People &apos;s Republic of China _ BAR _ 100 _ BAR _ 90 _ BAR _ 140 _ BAR _ 141 _ BAR _
( 114 ) It is highly unlikely that imports originating in third countries such as the Republic of Korea and Brazil may have contributed to the damage to the Community industry .
The market share of imports from countries other than the People &apos;s Republic of China in the UZ was only around 3 % .
In addition , the average prices of imports from the Republic of Korea and Brazil ( i.e. the third countries , in addition to the People &apos;s Republic of China , from which the largest quantities were imported ) were 25 % and 47 % higher than the prices of imports originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
in view of the market share and the relatively high prices of imports from other third countries , it can be concluded that , if at all , only have made only a minimal contribution to damaging the Community industry .
4 . Effects of competition between Community producers and overcapacity
( 115 ) Some interested parties claimed that the Community industry was forced to reduce its prices to a damaging level due to the overcapacity of the refractory -@ industry , the industry of the Community industry had been forced to reduce its prices in competition to a damaging level due to the overcapacity of the refractory -@ industry .
However , the capacity utilization identified in the study for the reference period , the development of which is listed in indexed form under recital 90 , does not confirm this claim .
Rather , it was comparable to the capacity utilization of the steel industry and other similar industries .
Although capacity was clearly reduced and prices fell , this was primarily a response to the increase in dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
the Commission also points out that by the end of the 1990s there was already a comprehensive restructuring of the Community &amp; apos ; s refractory -@ industry took place at the end of the 1990s .
5 . Effects of developments in the steel industry
( 116 ) It was claimed that the technical progress enabling the production of stones with a longer service life and efficient steel production has caused damage to the Community industry .
During the investigation , several steel producers said that their consumption of Magnesia -@ stones per tonne of steel had decreased as a result of technical progress .
_ BAR _ 2001 _ BAR _ 2002 _ BAR _ 2003 _ BAR _ UZ _ BAR _
Steel production EU -@ 25 ( kilotonnes ) _ BAR _ 180531 _ BAR _ 180758 _ BAR _ 183441 _ BAR _ 185197 _ BAR _
Consumption of Magnesia _ 39nesia -@ stones EU -@ 25 ( in tonnes ) _ BAR _ 399563 _ BAR _ 397203 _ BAR _ 401499 _ BAR _ 400638 _ BAR _
Stone consumption in the steel industry ( tonnes per kilotonne ) _ BAR _ 2,21 _ BAR _ 2,20 _ BAR _ 2,19 _ BAR _ 2,16 _ BAR _
This table shows that Magnesia -@ stones have only a share of about 2 % of steel production .
a decline in this share would therefore not explain the decline in selling prices and profitability described in the section on Damage section .
For this reason , the view is held that the higher technical quality of the stones could not have been a major cause of the damage to the Community industry .
( 117 ) The investigation showed that some steel producers continue to produce a certain proportion of magnesia -@ stones .
However , there is no evidence that this practice would have been expanded over time .
Moreover , since no steel company as a manufacturer of Magnesia -@ Steinen , was involved in the investigation , it can be assumed that this production sector had no impact on the economic situation of the Community industry .
6 . Effects of exchange rate fluctuations
( 118 ) Another factor allegedly responsible for the damage was the change in the exchange rate of the dollar and the euro .
This could be of concern , as the Chinese renminbi was pegged to the dollar for many years ; allegedly , the fluctuations in the dollar and euro exchange rate have made exports to the community more attractive to Chinese manufacturers .
( 119 ) However , the price loss of the dollar against the euro did not always coincide with the rise in imports .
The decline in the dollar exchange rate began in June 2002 , while imports rose significantly as early as 2001 .
In addition , freight costs from the People &apos;s Republic of China to the Community increased considerably over the reference period .
If imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China had increased only because market conditions had improved as a result of the exchange rate change , a decline or , in any case , a stabilisation of imports would have been expected as soon as the increased freight costs compensated for the exchange rate change .
although such a compensation actually took place ( in the last 15 months of the reference period , freight costs have risen by around 25 % , according to P &amp; O Nedlloyd ) , imports continued to increase .
( 120 ) For this reason , it is concluded for the time being that the effects of the exchange rate changes may hardly have contributed to the damage to the Community industry .
7 . Effects of imports of the Community industry into the Community
( 121 ) Some interested parties claimed that the damage was self-caused because the Community industry imported the affected goods from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
As already stated above , imports from the People &amp; Republic of China accounfor 5 % of its total sales on the Community market in the case of RHI , which is part of the Community industry , accounted for 5 % of its total sales on the Community market .
the share and difference in the prices of these imports compared to Community sales are relatively small and cannot have had a major impact on the market .
8 . Effects of exports in the Community industry
( 122 ) In the UZ , the Community industry carried ported around 27 % of its production from the Community .
the export volume decreased only slightly during this period .
However , the profitability of these exports was higher than that of Community sales , so that it cannot be said that they have contributed to the damage to the Community industry .
9 . Conclusion on the cause of damage
( 123 ) As already stated , the damage in this case was primarily in the form of price pressure , which caused a decline in profitability .
Taking into account the fact that the prices of rapidly increasing imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China were well below those of the Community industry , there is nothing indications that the factors mentioned above may have been a major cause of the significant damage to the Community &amp; apos ; s industry .
during the investigation , no other factors were found that could have caused the significant damage .
( 124 ) On the basis of this analysis of the impact of all known factors on the situation of the Community industry , it is provisionally concluded that there is a causal link between the dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China and the significant damage to the Community industry .
E. COMMUNITY INTEREST
1 . General considerations
( 125 ) It was examined whether there were compelling reasons for the conclusion that the introduction of anti-dumping duties on imports from the country concerned would run counter to Community interest .
the Commission sent questionnaires to importers , industrial users and suppliers .
Answers were given by one of 14 users , five suppliers and three independent importers .
( 126 ) The following conclusions were drawn on the basis of the information received by the cooperating parties .
2 . Interest of the Community industry
( 127 ) It is well known that the Community industry includes four manufacturers who employ around 800 people in the production and sale of the goods concerned .
It should also be remembered that the economic indicators examined above for the Community industry showed a deterioration in business results during the reference period .
despite the slight improvement in the UZ , the Community industry could not achieve a satisfactory financial situation due to the dumped imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
( 128 ) It is clear that in the event of a waiver of measures , more and more production facilities in the Community and that the steel companies will be much more dependent on Chinese goods .
There are currently only a few production sites worldwide , and the majority of the raw materials ( especially magnesium oxide ) are in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
For this reason , there are no major sources of supply in other third countries .
As a result , the introduction of anti-dumping measures would obviously benefit the Community industry .
( 129 ) For these reasons , it is provisionally concluded that the introduction of anti-dumping measures would be in the interests of the Community industry .
3 . Interest of independent importers
( 130 ) Four companies answered the questionnaire for independent importers , although only two of them imported the goods concerned in the UZ .
the cooperating importers opposed the introduction of measures , claiming that there were only a few large manufacturers of refractory products in the Community and that imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China had stimulated competition in the Community market .
If measures were introduced and prices rise , Chinese companies might reduce their sales in the community , and importers would incur losses as a result of reduced trade activity and lower profitability .
( 131 ) An importer argued that he may have to close his business with eight employees , since the goods concerned had a significant share of his business activities .
However , the aim of the anti-dumping measures is neither to prevent the import of the goods concerned , nor to make the activities of the importers in the Community more difficult .
as the proposed measures concern only a relatively small part of the total cost of the Community &amp; apos ; s steel industry and there are business relationships between Chinese implementing manufacturers and Community users based on specific technical requirements , it is in all likelihood that the traditional business of the importers will continue even if anti-dumping measures are introduced vis-à-vis dumped imports .
( 132 ) It was also found that the introduction of measures would have no significant consequences for the other importer , since the goods concerned only account for less than 1 % of the company &apos;s turnover .
4 . Interest of suppliers
( 133 ) The suppliers involved on the investigation shall support the proceedings .
two companies , which supplied the industry of the community with the most important raw material for Magnesia -@ stones ( burnt magnesite ) , claimed that they should have stopped supplying the refractory industry a few years ago , since first raw materials from the People &apos;s Republic of China and later also Magnesia -@ stones from the Republic of China came on the market .
5 . Interest of users
5.1 Preliminary remark
( 134 ) 14 user companies , i.e. steel producers , replied to the questionnaire and another manufacturer and the Steel Trade Association .
another user supported the request of the Community industry , but all other steel companies opposed the introduction of anti-dumping measures .
Overall , user companies accounted for around 38 % of the share consumption of Magnesia -@ Steinen .
5.2 Highly sensitive goods
( 135 ) Refractory materials are of the utmost strategic importance for the steel industry .
the entire steel passes through walled converters , furnaces and pans .
Supply difficulties could therefore have significant consequences in the form of production interruptions , repairs or security problems .
For this reason , stones of high quality , i.e. long service life , and good technical support for this type of product are very important .
Due to the high technical requirements , a lot of time , high investments and research are required to establish a supply relationship .
Switching from one Chinese manufacturer to another manufacturer would also be very difficult .
the steel producers claimed that over the last two years they have made good progress with Chinese manufacturers and their importers in the community over the last two years , mainly by improving efficiency and innovation .
( 136 ) The companies which objected to the introduction of measures therefore fear that there may be bottlenecks in the supply of high-quality stones and adequate technical assistance .
they fear that Chinese manufacturers would withdraw from the Community market in the event of the introduction of measures .
Furthermore , the largest occurrences of magnesite , the most important raw material for Magnesia -@ stones , are in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
the steel industry is therefore afraid that its relations with Chinese raw material suppliers may deteriorate .
( 137 ) However , as already stated above , however , the anti-dumping measures are not aimed at preventing the import of the goods concerned or to make the activities of the steel producers more difficult .
this means that non-damaging imports could continue to be imported into the Community .
Consequently , existing relations with Chinese exporters could be maintained even if anti-dumping measures were introduced compared to dumped imports .
This is also supported by the fact that the goods concerned have only such an insignificant share of the total production costs of the steel producers , that measures would have a minor impact on the costs of users ( see recital 142 ) .
( 138 ) It should also be borne in mind that the affected goods are of strategic importance for the steel industry .
in the event of a waiver of measures , there is a risk that the entire production of the goods concerned will be transferred to the People &apos;s Republic of China in the long term .
Given that there are no major manufacturers in other third countries , such a dependence on Chinese imports is clearly not a sustainable scenario for the steel industry
( 139 ) Furthermore , there is no evidence that the access to raw materials could be made more difficult for the steel producers who produce magnesia -@ stones for their own use could be made more difficult .
5.3 Market structure
( 140 ) The consumer industry claimed that the measures would strengthen a market structure with a few major manufacturers .
the users claimed that this lack of competition was the result of mergers and acquisitions in the firfractory industry in the 1990s .
( 141 ) The largest manufacturer in the Community had a market share of around 30 % in the UZ , which is unlikely to be enough to control and dominate the market .
this is underpinned by the fact that this market share declined as a result of imports from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
as stated above , these imports will most likely continue even after the introduction of measures .
Moreover , many small businesses in the community and even some steel companies themselves produce Magnesia -@ stones , and during the investigation no evidence was presented that the major producers in the Community dominated the market in the alleged way .
since no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour , the claim remains unfounded and unproven .
5.4 Higher costs
( 142 ) The steel industry also claimed that anti-dumping duties on Magnesia -@ stones would incur additional costs on the highly price-sensitive steel market and , above all , in competition with steel producers from third countries .
For this reason , anti-dumping duties would affect the competitiveness of the steel industry , especially since the pressure on the markets for other raw materials for steel products is also very strong .
( 143 ) Nevertheless , the answers of the consumer industry to the questionnaire show that the Magnesia -@ stones account for significantly below 1 % of the total cost .
Consequently , the proposed anti-dumping duties would only have a marginal impact on the total cost of steel production .
Recent developments in the steel industry clearly show a recovery in selling prices and profitability , further reducing the share of Magnesia -@ stones in total selling sales .
5.5 Conclusion on the interest of users
( 144 ) In view of the foregoing , it is unlikely that the anti-dumping measures on the Community market would reduce the supply or affect competition , especially as the Chinese Magnesia -@ stones are likely to continue to maintain their market share .
The rise in costs would only be marginal and would not significantly affect the competitiveness of the steel industry .
For these reasons , it is provisionally held that the interests of users do not speak against the introduction of measures .
6 . Conclusion on the interest of the Community
( 145 ) The introduction of measures against imports of Magnesia -@ stones originating in the country concerned would clearly be in the interests of the Community industry .
As for the importers / dealers and user industries , any impact on the prices of the Magnesia -@ stones are likely to be minor .
On the other hand , the loss of market share and profitability of the Community industry and the decline in its prices , on the other hand , are clearly greater .
( 146 ) In view of the above , it is provisionally concluded that there are no compelling reasons against the introduction of anti-dumping duties on imports of Magnesia -@ stones originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
F. ANTIDUMPIN MEASURES
1 . Damage removal threshold
( 147 ) In view of the conclusions on dumping , damage and Community interest , measures should be introduced to prevent further damage to the Community industry by dumped imports .
( 148 ) The tariffs shall be set at an level sufficient to eliminate the damage caused by these imports without exceeding the dumping margin identified .
In determining the rate necessary to eliminate the effects of harmful dumping , it was assumed that any measures should enable the Community industry to cover its total production costs and , in together , to achieve an adequate pre-tax profit , which could be achieved by an sector of this kind in the sector under normal competitive conditions , i.e. without dumped imports , when selling the similar goods in the Community .
This calculation was based on a profit margin of 8 % of sales was used on the basis of the profit margins before the occurrence of dumped imports .
on this basis , a non-damaging price of the similar commodity was determined for the Community industry .
the non-damaging price was determined on the basis of the production costs plus the aforementioned profit margin of 8 % .
( 149 ) The necessary price increase was subsequently determined by comparing the weighted average import price with the non-damaging price .
Import prices were corrected by 10 % for three reasons .
Firstly , the production sites of the Community industry were located near the steel mills , while the cost of transporting the import port and the insurance costs for imports were usually higher .
Secondly , the price that the Community industry to the respective steel mills during sale also included technical assistance , which was usually not the case with the exporters .
Thirdly , all sales of the Community industry were at the level of end consumers , while many import business took place at the level of traders who had additional costs .
( 150 ) Any differences arising in the comparison were expressed as a percentage of the average cif -@ import value .
the comparison was made on the basis of the product groups formed by PCN -@ numbers ( see recital 11 ) .
( 151 ) The provisional weighted damage margins for companies to which either individual treatment or market economy status was granted were :
- Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 17.1 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 42,1 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Kyushu Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 21.9 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Guangyang Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 21.9 % _ BAR _
- Yingkou Qinghua Refractories Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 54.6 % _ BAR _
- Dashiqiao Sanqiang Refractory Materials Co . Ltd _ BAR _ 66.1 % . _ BAR _
( 152 ) In connection with the calculation of the nationwide damage removal threshold for all other exporters in the People &apos;s Republic of China , it must be taken into account that cooperation was low .
For this reason , a range was calculated on the basis of the data of those cooperating exporters to whom neither MWB nor IB was granted .
Since this damage recovery threshold was lower than the highest damage margin in the case of the companies listed above , and in order not to reward non-cooperation , the nationwide damage margin was set at the level of the highest range determined above , i.e. 66.1 % .
2 . Preliminary measures
( 153 ) On the basis of the foregoing , it was held that , in accordance with Article 7 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation , provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
in accordance with the rule of the lower duty , the anti-dumping duties should be set at the amount of the dumping or damage range , depending on which of the two is lower .
Since the cooperation was low , the residual range was to be set in the amount of the highest for the cooperating manufacturers , i.e. in the amount of 66.1 % of the cif -@ price free limit of the Community , was to be set .
the company-specific anti-dumping duty rates set out in this Regulation have been determined on the basis of the findings of this investigation .
they thus reflect the situation of the companies during this investigation .
in contrast to the nationwide tariffs for &quot; all other undertakings &quot; , these tariffs therefore apply exclusively to imports of goods originating in the country concerned and are manufactured by the legal entities named by name .
Goods imported , which are manufactured by other companies not mentioned by name and address in the decreing part of this decision , including the companies affiliated with the expressly undertakings , are not subject to these individual customs duties , but to the customs applicable to &quot; all other companies &quot; .

of 11 April 2005
to stop fishing for deep-sea prarins by vessels flying the flag of a Member State with the exception of Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and Poland
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY -
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 2847 / 93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system for the common fisheries policy &#91; 1 &#93; , in particular Article 21 ( 3 ) ,
Considering the following reasons :
( 1 ) Council Regulation ( EC ) No 27 / 2005 of 22 December 2004 fixing down fishing opportunities and accompanying fishing conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of stocks in Community waters and for Community vessels in waters with fishing restrictions ( 2005 ) &#91; 2 &#93; provides for quotas for deep-sea prarimps for 2005 .

the Community has banned the fishing of this stock from 24 February 2005 .
it is therefore advisable to take over this date -
has FOLLOTHIS REGULATION :
Article 1

Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 558 / 2005
of 12 April 2005
amending Regulation ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 establishing a nomenclature of agricultural products for export refunds and Regulation ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 laying down specific implementing provisions relating to Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 804 / 68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the milk and milk products sector
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY -
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products &#91; 1 &#93; , in particular Article 31 ( 14 ) ,
Considering the following reasons :
( 1 ) Commission Regulation ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 &#91; 2 &#93; establishup the nomenclature of agricultural products for export refunds .
( 2 ) According to the reimbursement nomenclature , cheese shall be eligible for an export refund if they meet minimum requirements for dry milk matter and milk fat .
a type of cheese produced in certain new Member States could meet these requirements , but not benefit from a refund because it does not fall under the current classification system of the export refund nomenclature .
due to the importance of this cheese for the dairy industry , the trade and the respective milk producers , it is appropriate to add a product code under the heading &quot; other cheeses &quot; , so that the cheese can be included in the export refund nomenclature .
( 3 ) The quantities for which export licences are applied for in the product category &apos; cheese &apos; shall constantly exceed the profile of the export restrictions applicable to the Community in accordance with the Convention on Agriculture for the Community concluded under the multilateral trade negotiations of the Uruguay Round .
the additional export licences applied for under the newly created position will increase the pressure on this category .
4 . Pursuant to Article 3 of Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 &#91; 3 &#93; , no refund shall be granted for the export of cheese , the price of which is lower than EUR 230 per 100 kg before the application of the refund in the export Member State .
However , this provision does not apply to cheeses of code 0406 90 33 9919 of the nomenclature of export refunds .
in these circumstances , in view of the numerous applications for the issuance of export licences for cheese , it is appropriate to apply this provision without exception to all types of cheeses .
( 5 ) In accordance with the footnote 10 applicable to grated cheeses , cheese in powder form and processed cheese in Annex I Sector 9 to Regulation ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 , non-milk components shall not be not taken into account when calculating the refund .
this determination must be extended to all types of cheeses and the relevant non-dairy components must be described in more detail .
for the exporter and even more , for the competent authority , it can be very difficult or even impossible to determine the weight of these components .
therefore , it is advisable to cut the refund by a standard amount .
( 6 ) The refund shall be granted for the net weight of the cheese .
in cases where the cheese is enveloped in paraffin , ash or wax or wrapped in plastic wrap , there may be ambiguities .
It is envisaged that such an enclosure is not part of the net weight of the product for the purpose of calculating the refund .
in the case of plastic wrap , paraffin and ashes , it may be impossible for the exporter and the competent authority to determine the weight of these materials .
therefore , it is advisable to cut the refund by a standard amount .
( 7 ) Regulations ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 and ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 shall be amended accordingly .
8 . The measures provided for in this Regulation shall comply with the opinion of the Management Committee on Milk and Milk Products ;
has FOLLOTHIS REGULATION :
Article 1
Annex I to Regulation ( EEC ) No 3846 / 87 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation .
Article 2
Article 3 ( 4 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 is deleted .

Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 559 / 2005
of 12 April 2005
to launch an investigation into the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures introduced by Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2074 / 2004 vis-à-vis imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China by the imports of certain ring binder mechanisms sent from the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos , whether registered as a certificate of origin of the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos , and on the customs collection of the latter imports
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY -
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 384 / 96 of 22 December 1995 on the protection against dumped imports from countries not belonging to the European Community &#91; 1 &#93; ( hereinafter referred to as the &apos; Basic Regulation &apos; ) , in particular Articles 13 ( 3 ) , Article 14 ( 3 ) and Article 14 ( 5 ) ,
after consulting the Advisory Committee ,
Considering the following reasons :
A. ANTRAG
1 . The Commission shall received an application under Article 13 ( 3 ) of the Basic Regulation to investigate the alleged circumvention of anti-dumping measures vis-à-vis imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China ( hereinafter referred to as the &quot; People &apos;s Republic of China &quot; ) .
( 2 ) The application was submitted on 28 February 2005 by Ring Alliance Ringbuchtechnik GmbH on behalf of joint manufacturers , which account for more than 70 % of the joint production of certain ring binder mechanisms .
WARE
( 3 ) The goods affected by the alleged circumvention are certain ring binder mechanisms which are normally assigned to the KN -@ code ex83051000 , originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
this KN -@ code is only given for information .
( 4 ) The commodity , which are the subject of the investigation are certain ring binder mechanisms sent from the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; examined goods &quot; ) and which are normally assigned to the same KN -@ code as the affected goods originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
C. YEY MEASURES
( 5 ) The measures currently in force and possibly implemented are a final anti-dumping duty introduced under Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2074 / 2004 &#91; 2 &#93; , which has been extended to include imports of the same goods sent from Vietnam &#91; 3 &#93; .
d . GREEN FOR SUFFITCH
( 6 ) The application contains sufficient apparent evidence that the anti-dumping measures in force to the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China shall be circumvented by downlooading the examined goods in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos and / or their assembly in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos .
the following evidence has been provided :
- According to the request , the trade structure has changed considerably due to a significant increase in imports of the goods examined , while imports of the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China declined after the introduction of measures , for which there is otherwise no sufficient justification or justification apart from the introduction of the customs .
- This change in the trade structure seems to be due to the transhipment of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China to the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos and / or the assembly of certain ring binder mechanisms in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos .
- In addition , the request contains sufficient apparent evidence that the remedal effect of the anti-dumping measures originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China , will be undermined both in terms of quantity and prices .
Apparently , significant quantities of imports of certain ring binder mechanisms from the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos have replaced imports of the goods concerned originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
- In addition , there is sufficient evidence that the examined goods will be sold at prices that have been dumped compared to the normal value originally determined for certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
- If , in the course of the investigation , in addition to dispatch via the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos , other circumvention practices within the meaning of Article 13 of the Basic Regulation are identified in the course of the investigation , the investigation may also cover these practices .
E. PROCEDURE
7 . For the above reasons , the Commission has concluded that the evidence is sufficient to justify the opening of an investigation in accordance with Article 13 of the Basic Regulation and to cover imports of certain ring binder mechanisms sent from the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos , irrespective of whether or not their origin is indicated in the application with the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos , in accordance with Article 14 ( 5 ) of the Basic Regulation .
a ) Questionnaire
( 8 ) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation , the Commission shall send questionnaires to the exporters / manufacturers and their associations in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos , the exporters / manufacturers and their associations in the People &apos;s Republic of China and the importers and their associations in the Community involved in the investigation , which led to the existing measures , or which are referred to in the application , as well as to the authorities of the People &apos;s Republic of China and the authorities in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos .
where appropriate , information may also be obtained from the Community industry .
9 . All interested parties should ask the Commission immediately and within the time limit set in Article 3 , ask the Commission whether they are specified in the application and , where appropriate , request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3 ( 1 ) of this Regulation , since the time limit set in Article 3 ( 2 ) of this Regulation shall apply to all interested parties .
( 10 ) The authorities of the People &apos;s Republic of China and the authorities in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos shall be informed of the opening of the investigation and shall receive a copy of the application .
b ) Obtaining information and hearings
( 11 ) All interested parties shall be invited to state their position in writing by presenting relevant evidence .
The Commission may also consult to interested parties if the parties request in writing and demonstrate that there are particular reasons for their consultation .
( c ) Exemption from the customs collection of imports or measures
12 . As the alleged circumvention takes place outside the Community , in accordance with Article 13 ( 4 ) of the Basic Regulation , manufacturers of the goods concerned who can prove that they are not connected with a manufacturer subject to the existing measures and for whom it has been established that they are not involved in the circumvention practices within the meaning of Article 13 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation may be exempted from customs collection of imports or measures .
Manufacturers wishing to obtain an exemption should submit an application within the time limit set in Article 3 ( 3 ) .
F. CUSTOMS CONCUNTION
( 13 ) Pursuant to Article 14 ( 5 ) of the basic regulation , imports of the goods examined should be recorded in a customs basis so that , in the case where a circumvention is detected during the investigation , anti-dumping duties may be levied retroactively from the date of the customs registration on the imports sent from the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos .
g . FRISTEN
( 14 ) In the interest of proper administration , time limits should be set within which :
- interested parties can notify the Commission themselves , set out their position in writing and provide answers to the questionnaire or other information to be taken into account in the investigation ;
- manufacturers in the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Laos can apply for an exemption from the customs collection of imports or measures ;
- interested parties can submit a written request for consultation by the Commission .
( 15 ) It should be noted that the exercise of most of the procedural rights enshrined in the Basic Regulation presupposes that the party concerned shall register itself within the time limit referred to in Article 3 .
h . NOTHING WORK
( 16 ) If an interested party refuses to access the necessary information or does not grant it within the time limits set or significantly hinders the investigation , positive or negative findings may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the Basic Regulation , positive or negative findings may be made on the basis of the available information in accordance with Article 18 of the Basic Regulation .
( 17 ) If it is established that an interested party has provided untrue or misleading information , such information shall not be taken into account ; the available information may be basis in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation .
if an interested party does not or only in part and therefore base the findings on the available information in accordance with Article 18 of the Basic Regulation on the information available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation , this may lead to a result which is less favorable for that party than if it had worked ,

Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products &#91; 1 &#93; , in particular Article 40 ,
Considering the following reasons :
( 1 ) Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 1498 / 1999 of 8 July 1999 laying down implementing provisions to Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 804 / 68 as regards mutual communications from the Member States and the Commission in the milk and dairy products sector &#91; 2 &#93; has been repeatedly amended .
A number of amendments have been introduced with Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 and all regulations with implementing provisions .
for reasons of clarity , it is therefore advisable to repeal Regulation ( EC ) No 1498 / 1999 and replace it with a new regulation .
( 2 ) For the assessment of production and the market in the milk and milk products sector , regular communications on the functioning of the intervention measures provided for in Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 and , in particular , on the development of the inventories of the products concerned at the intervention sites or in private warehouses , are essential for the assessment of production and the market in the milk and milk products sector .
( 3 ) The determination of aid for skimmed milk processed into casein and refunds shall only be determined on the basis of communications on the development of domestic and world market prices .
4 . Acise and regular monitoring of trade flows , which can be used to assess the impact of the refunds requires information on exports of products for which refunds are fixed , in particular as regards the quantities for which the surcharge is awarded in the context of a invitation for tender .
( 5 ) In order to comply with the obligations arising from the Convention on Agriculture concluded during the multilateral trade negotiations of the Uruguay -@ Round , approved by Council Decision 94 / 800 / EC &#91; 3 &#93; ( hereinafter : &quot; Convention on Agriculture &quot; ) , additional and more precise information on import and export , in particular on the application for licences and their use .
For the best possible use , rapid information on the development of exports is necessary for the best possible use .
Under the same Convention , exports under food aid are not subject to the constraints in force to subsidised exports .
Therefore , the communications on export license applications , it must be distinguished as to whether these are notifications of licences requested for food aid deliveries .
( 6 ) Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 of 26 January 1999 laying down specific implementing provisions laid down to Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 804 / 68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the milk and milk products sector &#91; 4 &#93; contains specific provisions for the exports of certain dairy products to Canada , the United States and the Dominican Republic .
therefore , the transmission of the relevant information must be envisaged .
( 7 ) Regulation ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 provides for a special scheme for the granting of refunds for ingredients originating in the Community and used for the production of processed cheese in the context of active refinement trade .
therefore , the transmission of the relevant information must be envisaged .
8 . In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation ( EC ) No 174 / 1999 , in certain cases an export license may also apply to a product code other than the code specified in Section 16 of the export license .
therefore , the transmission of the relevant information must be envisaged .
( 9 ) In accordance with Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 2535 / 2001 of 14 December 2001 laying down implementing provisions to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 on the import regime for milk and dairy products and on the opening of the relevant tariff quotas &#91; 5 &#93; , certificates IMA 1 shall be issued by the competent authorities in third countries to manage certain import quotas .
Member States shall notify the Commission of the quantities of products for which import licences are granted on the basis of IMA 1 certificates .
Experience has shown that these reports do not always make it possible to closely monitor the course of imports in its individual phases .
therefore , the transmission of additional information must be provided .
( 10 ) The experience gained over the years in evaluating the information transmitted has shown that this information is often transmitted too often .
therefore , the frequency of certain communications must be reduced .
( 11 ) It is essential to be able to compare price quotes for products , in particular for the purpose of calculating refunds and aid contributions .
in addition , the plausibility of these price quotes must be explained by weighting the information .
( 12 ) The means of communication have developed a lot in recent years .
This development must be taken into account in order to make communications faster , more efficient and safer .
( 13 ) The measures provided for in this Regulation shall comply with the opinion of the Management Committee on Milk and Milk Products ;

Council Regulation ( EC ) No 564 / 2005
of 8 April 2005
to reamend Regulation No 1601 / 2001 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and the final collection of the provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain iron or steel cables and ropes originating in the Czech Republic , Russia , Thailand and Turkey
the COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 384 / 96 of 22 December 1995 on the protection against dumped imports from countries not belonging to the European Community &#91; 1 &#93; ( hereinafter referred to as the &apos; Basic Regulation &apos; ) , in particular Article 11 ( 3 ) ,
on a proposal from the Commission after consultations in the Advisory Committee ,
Considering the following reasons :
A. PREPOLENT PROCEDURE
( 1 ) On 5 May 2000 , the Commission opened an anti-dumping procedure &#91; 2 &#93; concerning imports of certain iron or steel cables and ropes originating in Turkey , among others .
( 2 ) This procedure ultimately led to the introduction of a final anti-dumping duty under Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 &#91; 3 &#93; in order to eliminate the harmful effects of dumping .
B. CONTRACT ON INTRODUCTION OF A INTERIM REVIEW
( 3 ) Has Çelik ve Halat Sanayi Ticaret A.S. ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; Has Çelik &quot; or &quot; applicant &quot; ) , a Turkish executive manufacturer of certain iron or steel cables and ropes made of iron or steel subject to the applicable anti-dumping measures , applied for a partial interim review of Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 .
( 4 ) This request pursuant to Article 11 ( 3 ) of the Basic Regulation , it was alleged that the circumstances relating to dumping on the basis of which the existing measures were introduced have changed and that these changes are permanent .
( 5 ) According to the application , the applicant has made structural changes which had a significant impact on the normal value .
In addition , the applicant argued that a comparison of the normal value based on his costs or domestic prices with the export prices to the Community would result in a dumping margin that would be significantly below the anti-dumping duty of 17.8 % on the imports he produces .
Therefore , the maintenance of the measures at their current level , which are based on the previously determined dumping margin , is no longer necessary to compensate for the dumping .
( 6 ) After consultations in the Advisory Committee , the Commission concluded that there was sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a partial interim review , so that it published a notice &#91; 4 &#93; and began an investigation limited to determining the existence of dumping with the applicant .
C. PROCEDURE
( 7 ) The Commission shall formally notify the representatives of the exporting country and the applicant of the opening of the partial interim review and shall give all parties directly concerned the opportunity to present their position in writing and request a hearing .
the Liaison Committee of the &quot; European Foundation of the Wire Rope Industries &quot; EWRIS ( the applicant in the previous proceedings ) sent an opinion .
( 8 ) The Commission shall also sent a questionnaire to the applicant , which he replied within the time limit set in the notice .
( 9 ) The Commission shall obtain all the information deemed necessary for the dumper investigation , examined it and made a inspection visit to the applicant &amp; apos ; s operation .
( 10 ) The dumping investigation concerned the period from 1 July 2003 to 29 February 2004 ( hereinafter referred to as the &quot; examination period &quot; ) .
d . WARE
affected goods
similar goods
( 12 ) Like the previous investigation , the examination also showed that the SGR , which the applicant manufactures and sells or carries out to the Community there have the same basic substantive characteristics and uses , so that they shall be regarded as similar commodity within the meaning of Article 1 ( 4 ) of the Basic Regulation .
E. DUMPING
Normal value
( 13 ) In the course of determining the normal value , it was first examined whether the domestic sales of the similar goods made by the applicant were representative compared to his export sales to the Community .
this was the case because the quantities sold domestically , in accordance with Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation , corresponded to at least 5 % of its total export sales to the Community in accordance with Article 2 ( 2 ) of the basic Regulation .
( 14 ) Subsequently , for each of the types sold by the applicant on the domestic market which , according to the results of the investigation , were directly comparable to the types exported to the Community , it was examined whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative within the meaning of Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation .
this was considered given if the total amount of domestic sales of a type during the investigation period amounted to at least 5 % of the total amount of export sales of the same type to the Community .
for most of the types exported to the Community during the period under review , a comparable type sold in representative quantities on the domestic market could be determined .
( 15 ) For the types of goods that reached the 5 % threshold , it was then examined whether domestic sales could be regarded as transactions in normal trade by determining the share of profitable sales to independent customers .
in all cases , more than 80 % of the total domestic sales of the respective type were profitable , so the normal value was based on the weighted average of all domestic sales during the investigation period .
( 16 ) For the types exported to the Community for which , according to the results of the investigation , no comparable types were sold on the domestic market , the normal value was calculated in accordance with Article 2 ( 3 ) and 6 of the Basic Regulation was calculated on the basis of the applicant &apos;s manufacturing costs for the types in question , plus an reasonable amount for selling , administrative and overheads ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; VG -@ costs &quot; ) and for profits .
the VG -@ costs was based on those recorded by the applicant for domestic sales of the similar goods .
the profit margin was based on those achieved by the applicant for domestic sales of the similar goods in normal trade .
Export price
( 17 ) As all exports of the goods concerned were sold directly to independent customers in the Community , the export price was determined in accordance with Article 2 ( 8 ) of the basic regulation on the basis of the prices actually paid or paid .
Comparison
( 18 ) The comparison of the normal value with the export price took place at the level ex works and at the same trading level .
In the interest of a fair comparison , corrections have been carried out on request in accordance with Article 2 ( 10 ) of the Basic Regulation for demonstrably affecting prices and their comparability in the factors of transport costs , insurance costs , provision , loading and ancillary costs , borrowing costs and commissions .
Dumping span
( 19 ) In accordance with Article 2 ( 11 ) of the Basic Regulation , the weighted average corrected normal value was compared with the weighted average net export price ex the works of the comparable type of goods in order to determine the dumping margin for each type of product .
( 20 ) This comparison showed that there was no dumping .
F. DURATION CHANGGE OF THE ENVIRONMENT
( 21 ) In accordance with Article 11 ( 3 ) of the basic regulation , it was also examined whether it could be assumed that the circumstances had changed permanently .
( 22 ) In this respect , the investigation showed that the applicant had made structural changes with a significant impact on production and organization , which resulted in a significantly higher production efficiency and thus a decrease in production costs , so that the normal value was lower compared to that in the period under investigation of the previous investigation ( 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000 ) .
Export prices rose over the same period and the investigation gave no evidence that this increase was only temporary .
( 23 ) It is therefore concluded that circumstances have changed in the long term , in particular to the rise in the prices of exports to the Community and the simultaneous reduction in production costs .
g . ANTIDUMPIN MEASURES
( 24 ) As no dumping has been established , the measures should be lifted vis-à-vis the applicant should be lifted .
( 25 ) The interested parties were informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which an amendment to Regulation ( EC ) No 1601 / 2001 should be recommended and were given an opportunity to comment .
( 26 ) As a result , the EEA sent some general comments , which mainly concerned the rising commodity prices after the period under investigation .
the EEA did not call into question the above dumping findings , but expressed concern that the applicant might be able to practise dumping .
( 27 ) With regard to the raw material prices , it should be noted that they may have risen after the period under investigation , this could not be taken into account in the dumping investigation for the applicant .
in the present case , the most important raw material is wire rod , a simple steel product , the prices of which usually fluctuate quickly .
Therefore , an increase in the prices of such a raw material cannot be seen as a permanent change that could invalidate the above findings .
( 28 ) Finally , it should be noted that the measures will only be repealed only for the applicant and not for Turkey as a whole , so that , in accordance with Article 11 ( 6 ) of the basic regulation , the applicants will continue to be included in the proceedings and can be re-examined in the context of a subsequent review carried out for Turkey .

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 384 / 96 of 22 December 1995 on the protection against dumped imports from countries not belonging to the European Community &#91; 1 &#93; ( hereinafter referred to as the &apos; Basic Regulation &apos; ) , in particular Article 8 ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 992 / 2004 of 17 May 2004 amending Regulation ( EEC ) No 3068 / 92 establishing a final anti-dumping duty on imports of potassium chloride originating in Belarus , Russia and Ukraine &#91; 2 &#93; , in particular Article 1 ,
after consultations in the Advisory Committee ,
Considering the following reasons :
( 1 ) By Regulation ( EEC ) No 3068 / 92 &#91; 3 &#93; , the Council introduced a final anti-dumping duty on imports of potassium chloride originating in , inter alia , the Russian Federation ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; Russia &quot; ) .
with Regulation ( EC ) No 969 / 2000 &#91; 4 &#93; , the Council amended the measures originally introduced by Regulation ( EEC ) No 3068 / 92 to imports of potassium chloride originating in Russia , among others , and extended their validity .
( 2 ) In March 2004 , by means of a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union &#91; 5 &#93; , the Commission launched a partial interim review of the measures relating to imports of potassium chloride originating in Russia , inter alia , in order to examine whether the measures had to be changed to 25 Member States ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; enlargement &quot; ) as a result of the enlargement of the European Union .
( 3 ) According to the results of that partial interim review , a temporary adjustment of the existing measures was in the interest of the Community in order to prevent sudden and excessively negative effects on importers and users in the ten new Member States of the European Union ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; EU--@ 10 &quot; ) immediately after enlargement .
4 . By Regulation ( EC ) No 992 / 2004 , the Council authorised the Commission to adopt commitments laid down in paragraphs 27 to 32 of that Regulation .
On this basis , in accordance with Article 8 , Article 11 ( 3 ) , Article 21 and Article 22 ( c ) of the Basic Regulation with Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 &#91; 6 &#93; .
( 5 ) In the case of an implementing manufacturer , the Commission adopted a joint commitment for imports of potassium chloride sold by JSC Uralkali , Berezniki , Russia and sold exclusively by the distribution company Fertexim Ltd , Limassol , Cyprus .
( 6 ) JSC Uralkali informed the Commission that it would henceforth process its sales to the Community through another company called Uralkali Trading SA , Geneva , Switzerland .
Therefore , JSC Uralkali and Fertexim Ltd requested an corresponding amendment to Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 on the adoption of the joint offer of commitments .
To this end , JSC Uralkali and Uralkali Trading SA have jointly submitted a revised commitment .
( 7 ) JSC Uralkali also pointed out that , within the framework of the obligation adopted by Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 , direct sales of JSC Uralkali to independent customers in the Community .
In the revised commitment , JSC Uralkali also undertakes to comply with its conditions for direct sales to the Community .
( 8 ) The Commission shall examine the commitment .
It concluded that the revised commitment offer met all the conditions laid down in Regulation ( EC ) No 992 / 2004 , and that in i the selling prices are set at a level that effectively contributes to the elimination of the damage , ii that companies comply with certain amounts of import for sales to customers in the EU -@ 10 and in iii they also essentially maintain their traditional sales patterns vis-à-vis individual customers in the EU -@ 10 .
It was also concluded that , as claimed by JSC Uralkali , the transfer of distribution of Fertexim Ltd to Uralkali Trading SA did not affect the effectiveness of the obligation or , according to the companies , its effective monitoring .
( 9 ) JSC Uralkali &amp; apos ; s application to exempt its direct sales to the Community from anti-dumping duties has been considered acceptable , as it is in line with the usual procedure of accepting proper commitments from manufacturers exporting directly into the Community .
( 10 ) In the light of the foregoing , it was deemed necessary to amend the part of Regulation ( EC ) No 1002 / 2004 ,
has FOLLOTHIS REGULATION :

Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 605 / 2005
of 19 April 2005
to amend Regulation ( EC ) No 296 / 96 on the disclosures to be provided by Member States and on the monthly adoption of the expenditure financed by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund for Agriculture ( EAGGF ) , Guarantee Section
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY -
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ,
Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1258 / 1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy &#91; 1 &#93; , in particular Article 5 ( 3 ) and Article 7 ( 5 ) ,
Considering the following reasons :
1 . Pursuant to Article 3 of Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 296 / 96 &#91; 2 &#93; , it shall be informed at regular intervals of the expenditure incurred by the Member States .
In order to avoid superfluous communications , it must be provided that this information must be transmitted monthly , without prejudice to the obligation of Member States to provide information provided to the Commission on a weekly basis in order to enable appropriate monitoring of expenditure development .
2 . Certain information to be communicclosed by the Member States should be transmitted electronically and in digital form so that the Commission can use it directly for accounting .
Nevertheless , in justified cases , the transmission must remain possible in a different way .
( 3 ) In order to simplify and streamline administrative procedures , the simultaneous transmission of a copy of this information in paper form should only be required for the monthly summaries .
4 . In practice , the indication of certain quantities or areas in the detailed notification transmitted by the Member States shall have little interest in the granting of monthly advances .
this information should therefore be dispensed with .
( 5 ) The Commission &amp; apos ; s payments from the budget of the EAGGF , Guarantee Section , shall be made exclusively in euros .
For their part , the Member States not participating in the euro , for their part , retain the choice between the euro and its national currency for payments to the beneficiaries .
However , the paying agencies of these Member States , which make payments both in local currency and in euros , should be obliged to always maintain separate bookings for the currencies used for payment .
In order to avoid a duplicate conversion of payments , it is appropriate that the possibility of reporting amounts paid in euros in local currency will be abolished .
6 . Insofar as , on the basis of the expenditure reports from the Member States , the sum of the commitments granted in anticipation in accordance with Article 150 ( 3 ) of Council Regulation ( EC , Euratom ) No 1605 / 2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation for the general budget of the European Communities &#91; 3 &#93; exceeds half of the corresponding total budget for the current financial year , the Commission must cut these commitments .
in the interests of good budgetary management , this reduction should be distributed proportionally to all Member States on the basis of reported expenditure .
7 . If the Community budget has not yet been finally established at the beginning of the financial year , in accordance with Article 13 ( 2 ) , the second subparagraph of Regulation ( EC , Euratom ) No 1605 / 2002 , payments may be made monthly per chapter up to one twelfth of the appropriations approved for the previous financial year .
In order to allocate the available funds fairly among the Member States , it is advisable that , in this case the advances be granted in the amount of a percentage of the expenditure reported by the individual Member States should be granted and that the remaining amount not received in the respective month in the Commission &amp; apos ; s decisions on the subsequent monthly payments .
( 8 ) In the context of the CAP @ reform and the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme , compliance with the payment deadlines by the Member States is essential for the proper application of the rules of budgetary discipline .
therefore , relevant provisions should be laid down , which will prevent as much as possible from exceeding of the annual appropriations available in the Community budget .
( 9 ) If there are delays in the transfer of the documents for payments under Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 817 / 2004 of 29 April 2004 with implementing provisions to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1257 / 1999 on the promotion of rural development by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund for Agriculture ( EAGGF ) &#91; 4 &#93; , it should be possible to postpone the payments to be made by the Commission to a Member State for the month of September until the following month .
( 10 ) Expenditure for the tanstantive measures carried out in the month of September in warehousing in the month of September shall be assumed at 50 % in October and the remaining amount in November .
In order to simplify accounting by the paying agencies , it is envisaged that the expenditure for these substantive measures will be taken over 100 % in October .
( 11 ) Rural development expenditure co-financed by the Community budget and national budgets shall be reported to the beneficiary no later than the second month after payment .
In order to harmonise the accounting rules in the area of the EAGGF , Guarantee Section , it is advisable that these expenses must be reported for the month in which the payment is made to the beneficiary .
( 12 ) Regulation ( EC ) No 296 / 96 shall therefore be amended accordingly .
( 13 ) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in line with the opinion of the EAGGF -@ Committee :
