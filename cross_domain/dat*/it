Anjuta -@ Manual 2.1.0
2007
Johannes Schmidjhs @ gnome.org
Introduction
Anjuta is a versatile integrated development environment ( IDE ) for the GNOME -@ desktop . It provides a variety of advanced development methods such as project management , program wizard , an interactive debugger , the interface designer Glade , the API -@ help Devhelp , the memory -@ Profiler Valgrind , the power -@ Profiler gprof , a class generator , a powerful source code editor , source code -@ browser and more .
in the following screenshot you will see some of what you will encounter in Anjuta .
please report all the problems you encounter when using Anjuta - this helps to improve the software as well as the Open -@ Source community .
first steps with Anjuta
Menus and key combinations
at the top of the Anjuta -@ main window is the menu bar , which allows almost the entire functionality of Anjuta can be accessed by menu items . Actions have been assigned depending on the type . File operations , for example , can be found in the file -@ menu .
Menu bar
Anjuta -@ menu bar
&quot; File &quot; menu
Key combinations are available for many menu items . All key combinations are displayed next to the assigned menu item , and some other helpful key combinations are listed here .
Switch editor page : Ctrl Image ↑ ( forward ) and Ctrl Image ↓ ( backward ) . You can also switch pages by right-clicking on the tab and selecting a file name from the pop-up menu ( this is useful if all pages are not immediately visible ) . Some working environments may have assigned these key combinations , in which case you must occupy them ( not in Anjuta ) differently if you want to use them in Anjuta .
Context help : Change F1 . move the input mark over the word ( e.g. a function name ) for which you want to call the API -@ help , and use this key combination . The context help only works when Devhelp is installed ; otherwise , the Context Help menu and the button in the toolbar are disabled . You can get Devhelp from the Devhelp -@ website . You must also need to install the corresponding Devhelp -@ books .
Automatic Completion : Ctrl Enter . Position the input mark exactly behind an incomplete word and use this key combination . A list of possible completements will be displayed on it . You can scroll through the list to find and select the desired addition .
further key combinations : look for key combinations shown to the right of menu entries , and key shortcuts can also be changed as explained in the note below .
Adjust keyboard shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts can be changed under Edit Settings in the Shortcut tab .
Main window
The main window contains several viewports that can be rearranged by dragging their respective title bar , which can also be minimized by the button on the left of your title bar .
the document window has only one document at a time ( if files are open ) . All file commands affect the active document . You can switch to any opened document by clicking on the respective tab . You can also do the same by right-clicking on any tab and selecting the desired document from the appearing pop-up window , which is especially useful if many files are open , but not all associated file tab are visible .
the project window contains the tree of the project files when a project is open , otherwise the project window is usually hidden . Double-clicking on any object in the project window opens this file .
The file window contains a file tree . If no project is open , the file tree usually shows the top folder of the file system , but this can be adjusted in the settings . When a project is open , all files of the project are displayed in the window . Double-clicking on a file opens it with the corresponding application , as specified in the GNOME MIME -@ settings .
The symbol window shows a tree of the available symbols in the project , which is formed by processing the ctags , and a double click opens an editor window with the respective file in the corresponding line .
there is also a searchder in the icon window where you can search for symbols .
the message window displays all outputs ( both stdout and stderr ) when an external command is executed . The message window is usually hidden , but is displayed when external commands are executed , such as compiling a file or project , error analysis , search , and many other operations . Anjuta also inserts its own messages here if necessary .
Messages in the preset foreground color ( usually black ) are normal messages . Orange messages are warnings , and red ones represent errors . Warnings and error messages are linked : a double click on such a message opens the corresponding file in the respective line number .
For example , if you compile a file that contains errors , red messages will explain the problems and indicate the error location , double-clicking on such a message opens the file and highlights the line with the error .
the terminal window is a terminal -@ emulator in which you can enter commands as in the GNOME -@ Terminal .
Session management
All settings , including window sizes and positions , will be saved when you exit Anjuta . A session management is still in development , so you should not terminate Anjuta with unsaved documents . Anjuta will warn you if you want to quit while unsaved documents are still open .
File operations
create a new file and insert text
create a new file
To create a new file , select FileNew in the menu bar , or click the New File button on the toolbar . A new page will be displayed in the editor ( or a new window if the parent document ? ) . New documents will be named New File 1 , New File 2 , New File 3 , etc .
Save file
You should save new documents as soon as possible to avoid data loss as a result of crashes .
File file -@ wizard
Creation wizard for files
the &quot; Open File &quot; dialog
A wizard can also be used to create a new file by selecting DateiNeuFile from the menu bar . The &quot; New File &quot; dialog opens . Select the file type and enter the file name . The extension will be added automatically . You can add license information and a file header . In case of a C / C + header file , you can also add a header template . Click OK to confirm the creation .
Anjuta occasionally creates new file windows during some operations . For example , some Subversion -@ operations such as diff and log create new file windows and output the output there . You can save the contents of these windows in files if necessary .
inserting macros
You can use macros to quickly edit repetitive text passages .
the macro -@ plugin must be activated .
Interrogative
There are two types of macros : Anjuta -@ macros and user -@ macros ( they are displayed as &quot; My macros &quot; ) , Anjuta -@ macros cannot be changed , but you can create and edit users -@ macros .
To insert a macro , position the input mark in the desired place . Select Edit MacroMacros .... A dialog will be opened . Select the desired macro from the list . The result of the macro -@ conversion is displayed in the window and a summary will be displayed in the dialog box . Select Insert . the converted macro text is inserted at the current position of the input mark .
Macro
the macro -@ dialog
another way to insert macros is to select Edit MacrosMacro ... , and then press the desired macro -@ key combination .
defining macros
In the Insert Macro window , select or select Edit Add macro macro ... . then the &quot; Add / Edit . &quot; window will enter the name of the macro , select or define a category and set a key combination , then edit text relative to your macro . The character &quot; _ BAR _ &quot; indicates the position of the input mark after running the macro . Click OK . the macro will be added to the list .
You can also delete a macro by selecting it in the list and clicking Remove , which is of course only possible with users -@ macros ( &quot; My macros &quot; ) .
Add / edit macro
Add / Edit dialog
Similarly , you can edit and change a macro by selecting it from the list and selecting Edit .
Macro -@ Keywords
Macro -@ keywords are available . You can be included in macro -@ definitions . Macro -@ keywords start and end with the sign &quot; @ . &quot;
Keyword to -@ Macro
the keyword -@ macro
Available macro -@ keywords are @ DATE _ TIME @ , @ DATE _ YMD @ , @ DATE _ Y @ , @ USER _ NAME @ , @ FILE _ NAME @ , @ FILE _ NAME _ UP @ , @ FILE _ NAME _ UP _ PREFIX @ , @ EMAIL @ , @ TABSIZE @ , @ INDENTSIZE @ , and @ USETABS @ .
open and save files
Dialog for opening files
open a file : to open an existing file , select File Open from the menu bar and click the Open button , or use the Ctrl O key combination . This will open the Open File dialog . Enter the name of the file you want to open , then click Open . To open multiple files at once , you can select several one by one by holding down Ctrl ; then click Open . if you have changed your mind , you can press Cancel to close the dialog without opening a file .
dialog for opening multiple files
the dialog &quot; Open file &quot; in multiple file mode
You can enable the Show Hidden Files setting in the pop-up window , which appears in the dialog for opening files . This setting makes hidden files ( their name starts with . &quot; ) visible in the file list . Cancel this setting back to not display hidden files . The dialog for opening files also has a built-in type filter . Select the appropriate file type filter in the dialog , and the file list will be limited to files of the selected type .
Save as file
Save a file : to save a file , select File Save from the menu bar and click the Save button on the toolbar , or press Ctrl . If the file is new , the Save As dialog will open , enter a file name and click Save to save the new file under the specified name .
automatic saving of a file
If automatic saving is activated , Anjuta does not automatically save new files . You must first save them yourself . The same applies to the Save All setting : Anjuta will not save new files as long as you have not yet saved them yourself .
Save a file under a different name : You can explicitly save a file under a new name by selecting File Save As from the menu bar . The Save File As dialog opens and asks you for the new file name . Enter the name and click Save .
Overwrite file when saving
If you use Save As with an existing file , the original will not be deleted . It will remain unchanged since the last saving . If a file with the new file name already exists , a confirmation dialog will be displayed to make sure you want to overwrite it , and with a click on Yes , the file will be overwritten with the one you save .
Close a file : to close a file , select FileClose from the menu bar , or click the Close button on the toolbar ( you can also close a file by clicking on the cross ( &quot; X &quot; ) in the File Name tab . ) . This will close the current file , if the file is new or not , Anjuta will ask whether the file should be saved before closing .
editing of files
Anjuta has a number of features to help you edit source files , and the following sections describe how some of the interesting features are used .
Editor edges
the toolbar for labelling
Editor margins : Editor margins are located to the left of the editor and are used for a number of a specific purposes . There are three editor margins available : the line number border , the marker border and the border for text folds . By default ( that is , at the first start of Anjuta ) , only the border for text folds is visible , the other two can be switched visibly via the View Editor menu .
The border for line numbers is the largest of all three borders ( and slightly darker than the others ) and specifies the line numbers of a document . The border for line numbers can be displayed or hidden via the menu item AnsichtEditorRand for line numbers . A left-click on the border marks an entire line ( including the line break , if any ) . You can set a font for the row number border in the settings .
If necessary , the text folded border may contain folding tree . A click on nodes in the folding tree opens code -@ blocks . An underline is displayed under a folded line to clarify that a code -@ block has been folded below the line . For more information about folding , read the section Text folding below .
hidden marker edge
Editor edges in case of invisible marking edges
if the marker border is not visible , Anjuta displays markers as the background color of a line . For example , if , for example , if a mark of a breakpoint is set for a line and the marker border is not visible , this line is displayed with a red background . Similarly , the background color will be deep blue or yellow for a bookmark and a line number marker , the background color will be deep blue or yellow for a bookmark and a line number marker .
Machining aids
Editor with editing aids
Syntax highlighting
Anjuta can highlight the syntax of many different languages , which is usually done automatically by detecting the file type based on the extension . If Anjuta cannot recognize a file type , no syntax highlighting is used .
Anjuta uses a property file called $ prefix / share / anjuta / properties / anjuta.properties , which has the same format as a SciTE -@ property file , but does not use all properties . The style of each element for all languages is defined in the file $ prefix / share / anjuta / properties / styles.properties , which uses some common properties defined by Anjuta in the file $ home / .config / anjuta / Scintilla / editor -@ style.properties .
Text folding
Anjuta can display code -@ folds for source files with languages structured in blocks ( such as C , C + , Pascal , and Java ) . All code -@ blocks in source files can be folded in and out by clicking on the folding points in the edge for code -@ fold of the editor -@ fensters ( usually a &quot; + / - &quot; icon or an arrow up / down ) , the folding points automatically appear in source files containing code -@ blocks .
Code means -@ Folding is especially useful when editing very large source files with thousands of rows , once parts are folded , a document seems to be smaller , and easy browsing and editing becomes possible .
please note that code -@ folding and editing are only available in the Scintilla -@ Editor .
automatic formatting of source code
Anjuta can automatically format C or C + source files or header -@ files . This allows a good overview of the source code , improves readability , reduces the likelihood of syntax errors and , above all , saves time .
You can search C and C + source files and header files using tags ? in the files . a tag ( or symbol ) refers to a named entity such as a function definition , structure , or macro . Anjuta searches open C -@ and C + source files and header -@ files for existing tags .
Symbol last -@ Browser
Anjuta automatically searches for tags in all source and headers -@ files of an open project . You can jump to any function definition , structure definition , class definition or other tags without opening the corresponding file beforehand . You do not need to know in which file the tag was found .
Day last -@ Reconciliation
You do not have to worry about matching and updating the tag -@ database . Anjuta does all this , you just have to decide which tags you want to start to !
search and replace text in files
search
To search for a string or a regular expression in the current file , select Edit Search Find or press Ctrl AltF and the Find dialog will open .
enter the string to be searched in the field and choose whether it is a normal string or a regular expression . You can also set the search direction , the observance of case sensitive , and the search area , clicking Search to start the search , click Search to start the search .
If the search is successful , Anjuta will start the search hit or performs another action ( according to the search action you selected in the Search Destget tab ) , and if the search was unsuccessful , Anjuta will display a message informing about it .
if you want to continue the search , click the Search button again or press Ctrl , so the next search hit is visited ( Use Shift Ctrl for the previous search hit ) . You can change the search text by entering the new string in the Search expression text box in the search dialog .
Dialogue &quot; search text &quot;
To stop a long search , press the Stop button to stop a long search .
Set the search area
In the Search Target tab , define the search area and the action to be performed in case of a search success .
You can set the maximum number of actions to perform .
&quot; Search destination &quot; dialog
You can choose which text to search for .
Choices for &quot; Search in &quot;
search in files
set in &quot; All project files for text search in your project , set searches in &quot; All project files &quot; for text search in your project .
enter the text to be searched in the Search Expression tab , enter the text to be searched and define the search settings , such as case sensitive or only full words into account .
To search text in multiple files , use the Find in field to enter file patterns . set the search variables and click Search to start the search , click Search to start the search .
File search pattern
specify a search process
You can select which action to perform with successful search .
depending on the previous selection ( search in , search direction , etc . ) , some operations are not available .
Choices for the &quot; Search Destget &quot; action
replace
Search and Replace is similar to the text search , with the difference that you can also enter the replacement text in the Replace with text box , and you can also specify whether you want to be asked before each replacement ( &quot; Replace First Hit &quot; and &quot; Replace All Hits &quot; ) .
Select Replace to replace the match or Continue to go to the next match .
Search settings
You can also save search options .
The object highlighted in red is the active one , the preselected object specifies search settings that are loaded when Anjuta is started .
Dialog for the search settings
print a file
Print preview for a C -@ file
Print preview
You can call the print preview with File Print Preview . The current file is mapped and a print preview is displayed . The source code highlighted in the editor is also similarly highlighted in the preview ( and in the expression ) . The tab Print in the settings of the editor -@ plugins further settings that allow the expression with line numbers , broken lines and / or headers .
Print settings
If you want to print and are satisfied with the preview , select File Print or Print in the preview window and the print dialog below will open , select the appropriate print settings and click Print to print the file .
You can also set portrait or landscape , paper size , page orientation , and paper type , do not forget to make the right settings for your printer , otherwise the expression cannot be as expected .
Print dialog
Anjuta has a powerful project management plugin that can open most of the projects based on automake / autoconf , in some unusually configured projects it may fail , but as long as the project uses automake / autoconf in a typical way , it should work .
create a project from a template
To create a new project , select the menu item DateiNeuProjekt ... to start the project -@ wizard . Read the first page carefully .
select the type of application to create on the second page , click Before to continue .
in the last step , you want to check the entered information and click Quit to create the project , click Finish to create the project .
once the project is created , you can test it and create or run it .
the import process only works if the existing project uses autoconf / automake or , in a certain extent , a Makefile .
load and save projects
Loading projects
To open a project , select Open Files .... Select the project file ( * .anjuta ) in the dialog and click OK .
If a project has recently been opened , you will find it in the Last menu , select the file name of the project from the list , and the project will open .
save projects
the project is automatically saved when closing , because all changes are made directly in the project structure .
