Pidge is right .
I &apos;m just a sle knocker .
I am not destined as the leader .
now I &apos;m not even worthy of being a paladin .
What was that ?
this is the red lion .
you have to go to him .
Never , Keith turned him off to tear off my head .
does he call you ?
I would prefer nothing , but the red is not meant for me .
-he chooses you .
-I don &apos;t understand that .
my father created Voltron , but Zarkon is a better leader in the battle , so he became Voltron &apos;s right hand .
Lance , when you accepted Keith as the new leader of Voltron , showed that a strong team is more important to you than your urge for fame .
like my father .
I do not disappoint him .
Go .
there are still only three .
where is the rest of the gang ?
we increase the pressure . Let &apos;s see who rushes to the aid .
Zethrid , shoot with the ion cannon at the black lion .
Why on the ?
on this lion is a bit different .
his pilot does not have full control .
and Zethrid ? just a grape shot .
we don &apos;t want any lasting damage .
Fine .
-Keith , what should we do ?
-we attack .
can you be more precise ?
we need a plan !
Keith !
I &apos;m fine .
but we can &apos;t make it on our own .
not necessary .
now it is slowly getting exciting .
-What was it ?
-The Old Tean spacechip .
Does anyone need help ?
Thank you , Coran .
Zethrid . You were waiting for it .
bombarded the ancient tean ship with everything .
yes , sir !
if anyone is still there , he will surely come out .
ok . we draw attention to the ship .
Man .
the lion is full on it !
be careful with him .
Fly your own lion , Keith .
-That was intention !
-This is way too chaotic .
we organize ourselves .
Keith , what should we do ?
we have to make Voltron , but we lack a lion .
no more .
-Allura ? -Yes !
awesome !
Just see , there are now five kittens .
your orders , sir ?
shall we lose the best ?
No , we have seen enough .
Retreat .
done !
it was on the verge , but yes , we made it .
Allura , you and the blue lion ?
how cool !
Yes , that was a surprise , but a joyful one .
we now know that Zarkon has a son .
- This is deeply disturbing .
-we need to find out more .
blue , we had some nice adventures .
I wanted to stay with you , but wishes are not always fulfilled .
I will miss you , buddy .
pink ? not what I expected .
but I like it .
Yes , on Altea we carry this color in honor of our fallen warriors .
I carry them in honor of the old paladins .
and Shiro .
that is yours .
I had to lose the blue . at least to you .
- Princess !
the black lion flies away !
-eith , where do you want to go ?
to Lotors ship is a tracking transmitter .
bring all your lions .
we persecute them .
you wanted me to lead Voltron . That &apos;s the case .
Lotor is on the other side .
in an hour we are close to the attack .
good .
Keep Formation .
I am sorry .
Is an attack now a good idea ?
not everyone comes along with their lion .
-Do you mean me ? -you ?
No !
No , certainly not .
but half of the team sits in new lions .
maybe we should not take over .
Tell our hot-headed leader .
you wanted me as a leader , now you complain .
Lotor is the heir of the Galra -@ Throns .
we end his rule .
Allura , all ok in the blue ?
yes , I flew half my life the castle -@ Schiff .
I just have to get used to the lion .
well . then we start the attack .
in a Varga the lions arrive .
your orders ?
we should turn and shoot .
we heard all five lions are ready for action .
but otherwise we know little .
keep the ship on course until my return .
makes my hunter ready .
I attack the lions themselves .
you cannot defeat them alone .
I don &apos;t intend to do that either .
-There is a movement .
-so much about surprise .
this is just a hunter .
where are the others ?
They hide well .
we turn it off .
-Lance , what is that ?
-Sorry me !
the red is unusually fast for me .
where did the hunter ?
Come , move !
I can &apos;t shake it off .
drives him away .
I come .
-Allura !
- Sorry , Keith .
Seriously , does the thing braking ?
Allura !
Allura !
what ?
he plays us off against each other .
- This must be Lotor . -Au !
Allura , everything ok with you ?
yes , but the control is not like the lock -@ ship .
what &apos;s wrong , lion ? do what I command you .
move !
we should tell Allura that the lions work differently .
I told her not to roar at him .
and she has yat to me .
Yes , forget it .
It scares me .
I can hear you !
-Keith , what should we do ?
- if possible , does not get in my way if possible !
great leader .
that doesn &apos;t work .
we have to make Voltron .
People , in formation flight .
People ?
the Voltron -@ feeling does not come up .
continues !
it doesn &apos;t work !
-What &apos;s going on ?
- People !
the hunter !
how disappointing .
Apparently , the reality of Voltron does not do justice to the legend .
that was embarrassing .
and , do &apos;s leave it , fly back , reforming ourselves , eat something ?
No !
I know we have difficulties , but Lotor can &apos;t escape .
Acxa . Set course on the coordinates .
I will lure the lions there .
to the Thayserix ?
Why ?
these are not the paladins that defeated Father .
what ?
How do you know ?
They do not fight as a unit and cannot form Voltron .
my father probably did as much damage to the team as they did .
Anyway , they are vulnerable , and we must take advantage of that .
we recalibrate your hunters for the atmosphere on Thayserix .
what ?
what happens on Thayserix ?
the planet consists of dense gases and has magnetic poles that affect normal sensors .
when the lions are there , they are blind .
nothing for ungood , Narti .
keep the cruiser in orbit around Thayserix .
I scare away the lions , and you grab them .
he hides .
we don &apos;t follow him better , than what awaits us ?
Guys , we have a problem !
my sensors play crazy .
probably because of the atmosphere and the magnet -@ Poland of the planet .
We have no time for that .
he must not escape .
without the sensors and the equipment , we do not see where is above and bottom or how we get out .
-we should go back . -No !
fly on !
what ? I just heard &quot; flying . &quot;
have we fly back ?
do you also hear a noise ?
I no longer see you .
-acht slower !
-we must stay in it .
- He escapes .
-gases make radio contact more difficult .
we have to stay together to communicate .
we have probably survived the worst .
No ! No !
Allura was hit !
I fly after her .
Hunk !
you others stay with me !
Keith , we should take care of Allura .
Keith , you separate the team !
Keith , don &apos;t do that !
stop playing with them !
get them ready !
-is it all doing well ?
-I &apos;m sorry I was braking . -the blue one does not listen to me .
-Already ok .
our team holds together .
-or , Keith ?
-it &apos;s not just about the team .
the mission is more important than any individual .
we have to find lottery and stop him , and that &apos;s exactly what I intend to do .
comes , people , we should stay together .
Prince Lotor needs your support on Thayserix .
we are waiting for you immediately here .
Lotor is directly above the lion .
and they have no idea .
why doesn &apos;t he shoot ?
he could tear them in shreds .
-Blow them up !
-That is not possible .
the area is full of red syntian -@ nitrate , a highly explosive gas that reacts to increased light -@ emissions .
that will be good .
this is crazy .
we see practically nothing .
stays together .
he must be somewhere here .
I know .
there !
-Where is he ? -Who knows ?
the radars do not work .
Guys . Do you also feel he is playing with us ?
I see it the same , big .
the guy scares me .
-he probably lured us deliberately .
-Up there !
we have to get away !
this is a trap !
the tide has turned .
the hunters become the hunted !
Hunk , knocking sayings , doesn &apos;t take us any further !
Lance is right .
stay calm , get ready .
he attacks .
forms a circle .
we must be prepared for everything .
as soon as you see him , you fire with all that you have .
now !
Fire !
Hello ?
Paladins ? Help !
Wow , you can hide , but I will find you .
what happened ?
where is the rest of the team ?
that alone is my fault .
I am fully trapped into his trap .
everyone warned me , but I didn &apos;t want to hear .
I put the whole team in danger .
Yes , somehow .
but now we have to do that .
you are right .
we withdraw .
Hello ?
Does anyone hear me ?
Is there anyone ?
Pidge .
Hunk !
Oh my God .
I am glad I found you .
Do you repair the radar , find the rest and get us out here ?
I can &apos;t calibrate without a data constant , that would have gone before we flew into this gas -@ planet .
- what does that mean ?
-That is , we are sitting in the clamp .
Hello ?
can anyone hear me ?
ok , stay calm , Allura .
Think .
what would Lance do ?
Hallihallo , blue lion .
you know ... you are now really activating my particle barrier .
nothing works .
I tried it with kind requests and orders .
what do you ask of me ?
I can &apos;t .
everyone relies on me .
the whole universe . but I can &apos;t control everything .
I ... I need your help .
I hear you .
help me .
lead me .
I can &apos;t do it alone .
a sonar card .
do you also think what I think Blue ?
someone has learned something .
Come on .
almost .
Nitrate gas !
do the freezing beams work ?
I have no control over the left wing .
good , Paladin .
we made it , Blue .
now we have to find the others .
Hey , Pidge .
would you be stranded on a planet and allowed to eat something ...
What would that be ?
a Burrito ?
you like Burritos .
I would take a burrito .
Hey , I call Pidge and Hunk .
- Are you paladins looking for a way out ?
-Madness !
you have found us !
Allura has found you .
She has found us all .
-It connected with the lion .
-how did you do that ?
I behaved like Lance and stopped thinking .
Yes , think like Lance .
-Moment times , do you call me stupid ?
-No , you are a natural talent .
-Yes , of course stupid .
-from birth .
it &apos;s nice to raise Lance . -but we have to find out here .
- Follow me .
I know the way . waiting for a tick .
we have company .
-Lotor has probably called reinforcement .
- Oh man , something is always .
we have to make Voltron .
but last time we could not make Voltron .
we have to try .
maybe we were too divided and disorganized , we can only get out here when we work together .
we are a team .
Shiro believed in us .
we must believe in ourselves .
do you think so ?
-Yes ! -so then ...
makes Voltron !
I recognize an unknown energy -@ signature .
-Hunk , I &apos;m a leg .
-Pretty cool , right ?
Lotor escapes .
shall we fly after him ?
No .
we brought ourselves into this situation through false ambition .
we must be ready for him .
understood , team leader .
where do we flying ?
Voltron is there in the back .
we have to fight now !
a leader knows when to leave the battlefield .
we decide when we face them .
You can form Voltron again .
is this a problem ?
No .
a opportunity .
-What is it ?
-Yes , we do not know this alarm .
Allura , what is ?
were you seeing a ghost ?
we have .
this is an Old tean emergency call .
of King Alfors ships .
-are we not the last Alteans ?
-oment .
what if this is a trap ?
this is an ancient tean ship , and we fly there .
this is a Tel -@ Galax -@ exploration ship .
it explores the depths of space .
according to the identification code , the Traylings is a fleet cruiser .
but there is nothing to goal or mission .
-What &apos;s wrong with him ?
-is this a wormhole ?
this is not a normal wormhole .
it generates huge amounts of energy where the ship is stuck .
we see if someone is on board .
You need help .
we could send a drone to take a closer look at that .
good .
the energy is neither radioactive nor thermal .
It also does not produce gravity , and the light shates out , unlike black holes .
-but where does the light come from ?
-I know this energy -@ signature .
this is quintessence !
not good .
ok , do we stay away from the thing , right ?
is not possible .
have you not seen that ?
Voltron is much more stable than anything else in the universe .
we received an old tean emergency signal , so there is someone on the ship .
as Paladins of Voltron we have to help .
but I still believe this could be a trap .
and it &apos;s too dangerous to fly in anyway .
I fly alone when I have to .
ok , very slowly .
Pidge , can you explain this to me before us ?
the Euclidean space around the ship is an anomaly .
but the energy does not come from a source that fits into our reality .
that was probably a no .
I scan for biorhythms .
strangely , I don &apos;t receive signs of life .
maybe not here , but the ship is bigger .
-we have to go through it .
-through the glowing inferno ?
Pidge , keep an eye on Voltron &apos;s functions .
we break off immediately when it gets precarious .
then we break off immediately .
Guys , my sensors are crazy .
we should explode just like the drone .
but somehow the space curvature does not affect Voltron .
Hello ?
What can you see ?
the connection breaks off .
Hello ?
No !
we have to be through . That is the nose of the ship .
Moment .
the rear part of the ship is gone .
Coran ! Coran !
we can no longer see the castle .
-Coran , do you hear me ?
and where does the planet come from ?
according to the sensors , we are exactly where we were .
People , that sounds strange now , but now I receive several biorhythms .
Alteaner .
it seems that there is only one way to find out what &apos;s going on .
Hello ?
is anyone here ?
here it is totally scary .
does anyone else think this is a ghost ship ?
or just me ?
did the crew give up the ship ?
unclear , but without the spacesuits they did not come ...
there is someone in there !
Thanks to King Alfor we found the second meteorite .
we have recovered it , but it causes serious disturbances .
we fly to Altea , but it is unclear whether we can make it .
at the moment ...
what happened here ?
something deadly .
that still does not explain the biorhythms .
Be careful !
-Ungrasped .
Shiro ?
1xProtective ...
back !
you never get the meteorite .
I die rather than that I leave him to Alteans .
Shiro , please .
My name is Shiro .
What &apos;s going on here ?
why does he suddenly talk so strangely ?
-You know us ?
-Of course !
you are our leader and a paladin .
and you are Slav .
I have freed you .
- you &apos;re mistzy .
-That may be true , but you have never freed me from anything .
or ...
this is a parallel universe .
what please ?
when we flew through the energy field , we landed in a parallel universe .
something like that Slav always talks about ?
not you .
Yes , but another .
-he is constantly talking about other realities .
-seems familiar to me .
were you attacked the crew ?
-Back , Altean .
-we do not .
but it is good that they are dead .
-Oh no , even more Alteans !
-What ?
even more Alteans ?
You have noticed your arrival .
Sven , away here !
prefers to disappear .
What &apos;s going on here ?
does that mean a bunch of Alteans enters the ship ?
Weapons away !
Alteaner .
impossible .
Empress .
I am confused .
how was that ?
are you Empress Allura ?
I am Princess Allura .
please rise .
I am commander Hira , empress .
how can that be ?
you set down the Galra -@ uprising . You founded our realm . 10,000 years ago .
where we came from Zarkon destroyed your planet and extinguished the Alteans .
where do you come from ?
fascinating .
your theory about Voltron has been confirmed .
I had hoped to experience a bigger fireworks display .
all previous salvage -@ attempts , were more entertaining .
Well , not for your pilots .
Voltron came through because he is made of the same material as the meteorite that King Alfor wanted to hide from his father .
Let &apos;s see if the new paladins bring it to us .
and when Voltron is trapped in the other dimension ?
in the other reality , Ezor .
and when Voltron is trapped in the other reality ?
Voltron is stuck there , we are rid of him .
if he comes back with the meteorite , we get it .
for us , both are a victory .
this is the meteorite that Trayling was talking about .
he is stuck between the realities . like the ship .
can you take a sample ?
I try .
incredible .
this is Voltron .
what ?
it is of course not really Voltron , but the energy waves are the ones that Zarkon was looking for .
and those who led us to the blue lion .
so you could come into this reality .
Your vehicle is made of the same transreal material .
That &apos;s why Voltron is so powerful .
with this material Altea can build its own transreal ships .
we can extend our peace to all realities .
General Hira , I have discovered something on the ship that secures Altea &apos;s rule over millennia .
the Alteans of this reality have defeated the Galra ?
under your guidance , Empress .
If you had not fought and avenged your father , Altea could never have provided peace throughout the universe .
that is the last one .
do you think the plan works ?
Don &apos;t worry .
I am 60 % sure this is one of the 0.15 % realities in which this plan works 100 % .
whether the people from the other reality help the Alteans ?
If they are really my friends , 72 % likely that they will decide right .
first we had to beat Zarkon . Since then we have been bringing the true peace of Altea to all the worlds .
that is wonderful .
no stress , no wars .
-That is unimaginable . -really ?
take Moxilous .
For centuries , his people waged war against his neighboring planets .
what a barbaric life .
but look at him now .
what is different ?
the Hoktril .
the greatest technical achievement of our civilization .
What does he do ?
he deprives our enemies of their fighting power .
their will , one could say .
we are on .
who was still lost in Empress Allura &apos;s time will be rehabilitated .
Peoples who have waged war for millennia can now live in peace and support our new order .
as part of the Old Tean peace movement ?
are we talking about slavery ?
No .
without will they are not slaves .
Slaves are constantly fleeing or rebelling .
the controlled ones like to do what they are told .
the protection of life is a top priority in our empire .
and with this we achieve more than we have ever dreamed of .
but you take their free will from them .
the will that would kill you without hesitation .
Thanks to us , no innocent person must die by the free will of an evil being .
Empress Allura , I &apos;ll show you something .
this is our Altea .
comes with us .
Let me show you all its splendor .
does anyone else find these guys oblique ?
Something is wrong with these old people .
they have crashed the brain of the big guy .
Huhu , up here .
how did you find us ?
-the probability was great ...
-All right , forget it .
we have to get away to Keith and Allura and the meteorites .
we are our turn .
but you have to help us with one thing .
perfect .
I suspected that forces of the Gamara are on board .
but not that Empress Allura &apos;s friends help them .
See Altea again .
it seemed an unrealizable dream that I never dared to dream of .
Allura , that &apos;s not the Altea you knew .
that is true .
this Altea has prevented the Galra from spreading throughout the universe , as with you .
Empress , we will do everything we can to help you .
the meteorite on this ship can travel between realities .
If you activate this ship , we can free the ship and the meteorite from the crack .
then we fly into your universe and bring you peace . even the Galra .
thinks well about it , Allura .
Recently we thought all Galra were evil .
maybe it is not as easy as it does .
Keith , that is my people . That would be the strongest alliance we have .
I tried everything .
I can &apos;t find Voltron .
how should I stop them ?
you know them .
I don &apos;t understand a word , but I suppose it was an insult .
not good .
managed , Allura .
We will soon carry our peace into every reality .
What is that supposed about ?
Empress , the forces of the Gamara are on board .
They helped them .
release our friends .
Hira , you and all of Altea have transformed the universe into a slave realm .
no one is free .
Slaves ?
Is that true ?
the controlled ones are not slaves .
and you spread chaos and destruction !
we will scan your brain and find out where the rebels are .
finally the war can end .
-Allura , we must not allow that .
-Hira , please .
we both want the same .
Peace .
Oh yes ?
by your weakness your people suffer from the Galra .
but we gave our peace .
and now we bring peace to every reality .
you are not my empress .
and you are not an alttean .
what to laugh about ?
we are in reality where everything goes well .
perfect timing .
on him !
los .
-Pidge , where are the lions ?
-left down !
Sven , all ok ?
you saved me .
that will be again .
just takes me to the hospital .
we are stuck . to all :
hold on !
does he do this in every reality ?
I take care of Sven .
Get your lions !
I &apos;m to blame .
I activated the spaceship .
They get the meteorite and terrorize every reality .
No , you can recapture the meteorite !
-Pidge , look for the meteorite .
-I have already located his signature .
we fly in and get it .
makes Voltron !
ok , and what now ?
we can only return at the point of our arrival .
shoot down !
-Activate drive .
-Drive ready .
What &apos;s going on ?
Drive failed .
Persecution is impossible .
I love this reality !
destroy them !
I have it !
No !
you are back !
Thanks to the ancestors !
Paladins , do you hear me ?
all ok ?
nice that my emergency signal lucked you up , Voltron .
do you hear me ? all ok ?
Coran , we are still alive .
Allura , you have done the right thing .
Hira was not allowed to have the meteorite .
-but now Lotor has him .
-You could not guessed that .
that is the problem .
we are always unsuspecting .
therefore my father sent the lions away .
to protect them from this reality .
-Finally I understand it .
-we get it back .
and if not ?
Lotor is always one step ahead of us .
he has something in mind with the meteorite , and if he succeeds , the Galra have a weapon that is as deadly as Voltron .
ok , people , target targeted .
I give you cover ... Hey , Keith , I would have caught it !
there are still some !
that was awesome !
Pidge , could you give some gas ?
Loading ... About
done !
super , Pidge .
-This is the last outpost here .
-Contact the blade of Marmora .
tells them the base is liberated .
Well , I only remember how Zarkon wanted to steal the lion and I should use the Bayard .
after that I don &apos;t know anything about that .
I just woke up on the Galra -@ ship .
you have activated the teleportation mode of the black lion .
did he teleport you ?
maybe he wanted to help you .
by delivering me the Galra ?
maybe Zarkon has manipulated him .
he tried to control the lion until the end , right ?
Yes , maybe .
So as soon as you feel up to it , the others are happy to see you .
They need you .
Yes , I &apos;m trying .
ok , we are on the bridge .
-ey , Keith ?
-Yes ?
how many times will you save me before all this is over ?
as many times as I have .
good work , people .
you have brought the decisive turn .
good that you have remained faithful to the mission .
you look good .
How are you ?
good , except for the funny headaches .
Guys , I have something about it .
I downloaded data from the fallen Galra -@ base .
I decphered them and found something about lottery .
-Do you know where he is ?
-No . but his command ship was sighted in the Va &apos;Kar -@ Quadrant .
well done , Pidge .
but these quadrants are huge .
how can we find him ?
the comet is made of the same material as Voltron .
I scan for Fraunhofer -@ lines , just like the blue lion .
these are subject to free induction decay .
that is exponential .
but if we amplify the sensors ...
No , too many interferences .
-Let &apos;s increase the radiance .
-tops of the lock !
awesome !
I only understood station .
We are now heading on the Va &apos;Kar -@ Quadrant .
it hurries .
who knows what Lotor intends to do with the comet ?
yes ?
Hey , man , I wanted to talk to you briefly because ...
because I &apos;m worried .
definitely when you come to me with it .
-you are now finally the leader .
treasures .
I have expected .
we are now six paladins , but we have only five lions , that is , we are a paladin too much .
there you are right .
Shiro takes over the black , you want your red one .
and I would have to take away the blue from Allura .
but she learns faster than all of us .
It could achieve unexpected things .
that is true .
so I would do the team a favor if I left .
What are you talking about ?
it is not about ego .
we have war .
it is necessary to choose the best .
Don &apos;t break your head , and think of the mission .
that will be .
ok , thank you .
And , Lance leave the Computing Pidge .
Thank you for joining this .
I would never have got there .
I know you are dirty .
I owe you a shower .
but first we are looking for a lottery , right ?
let &apos;s throw the thing and see if it works .
maybe the polarity is not true .
People .
I have the comet , but it moves .
Coran ?
Allura ?
can an Altean push the lock ?
we are our turn .
we are making up .
keep a distance so that we don &apos;t be noticed .
the signal came to stop in the Ulippa -@ system .
activate scanners .
this is not a lotor .
but the comet is inside .
1Ok , people ...
-we do the following ...
Oh , I &apos;m sorry .
leg los , Shiro .
we need the comet .
he should safely enter the base .
it is vulnerable during transport .
there we strike .
who , to the vulture , are these types ?
a transport is probably not the plan .
-we need more detailed information .
-Take the black lion .
I support you with Coran .
Keith , are you sure ?
yes .
-What &apos;s going on ?
-Shiro , where do you stay ?
we need you !
-eith , you have to lead the mission .
-What ?
Why ?
the black lion does not respond .
you are probably his paladin now .
I come .
this is the worst base in the empire .
but it is my base !
Victory or death !
we have to find the comet .
then we find out who the guys are .
have you gone water ?
Lotor sends you to finish what he started ?
we are on board .
no trace of the crew .
we keep looking .
here long .
I kill him !
-No , you know the plan !
-My life is unimportant .
only the empire counts !
disconnect systems .
sounds like the battle is over .
quickly on .
I open the roof .
Coran , enlarge the picture .
is the ...
the Teludav !
what , in the name of King Groggerys the frail , is that ?
he must be here .
right in front of us .
where is the comet ?
in the ship ?
I think the ship is the comet .
he built a ship from the ore of the comet so fast ?
-That is bad .
Terrible even .
Loading ... About
in the Galra -@ base there is a part of the Teludav .
who worched the Zarkon &apos;s ship ?
but they can &apos;t serve it without Old tean ...
Zarkon &apos;s Witch !
She had Old tean times .
-Is anyone else frepping out here ?
-Yes , I sign up for freaking out .
Lotor must be here .
we finally have to turn it off .
Lotor is not allowed to have the ship .
back to the lions , and form Voltron !
why destroy the ship if we can turn off lotor ?
he constantly outwits us .
That is why Lotor is not allowed to get this ship .
too dangerous .
Keith , I want to stop Lotor , but Shiro is right .
ok , go to the lions .
I &apos;m looking for Lotor .
Keith , you have to stay together .
-I agree with Shiro . -I too .
-I too .
-Yes .
Well , then let &apos;s go .
I &apos;ll help you !
Pidge , help me !
I rarely fight against worthy opponents .
to destroy you will give me joy .
we have no time for it .
to the lions !
good idea .
Zethrid , stop !
Come on !
we can finally destroy them .
we have what we wanted .
stick to the plan .
seriously . what &apos;s going on here ?
who are they ?
I saw one of them in the weblum .
She stole Scaultrit .
and they have an Altean woman ?
You want to open wormholes with the Teludav .
was the ship out of the comet , we have quite different worries .
I thought Lotor took over for Zarkon .
why does he attack a base ?
No idea , so we must finally stop him .
-we have to stop the transport ship .
-Is made .
-That must be the ship out of the comet .
-Caution .
Drive up particle barrier and defense systems .
-a fast , small bastard .
- a damn manoeuvrable .
-the particle barrier is damaged .
-people , where are you ?
another hit , and it &apos;s over !
makes the sword !
occupy Voltron until the ship is out of reach .
Don &apos;t let yourself be provoked .
the sword is deadly .
it &apos;s too fast !
People who escape the cargo ship with the Teludav .
I thought we should destroy the comet -@ ship .
but Lotor must not have the Teludav .
Shiro is right .
we destroy him .
but the comet -@ ship is in front of our nose !
Keith , the cargo ship escapes !
good like that .
You must defend themselves or pursue the Teludav unprotected .
-the Teludav escapes !
-eith , what now ?
lowers the shield , and shoots at the cargo ship . risks it .
or we first hit this and then the cargo ship .
no time !
you have to decide !
Hunk , your Bayard .
we lower the shield and shoot at the cargo ship .
-ready ?
-ready !
They attack the cargo ship .
image may contain indoor .
go !
Fire !
once again !
Your failure is extremely disappointing .
comes back before more Galra -@ ships appear .
So Lotor attack the Galra -@ base to steal the Teludav ?
how confusing .
no matter , they escape !
-Afterwards . -No .
comes back to the castle .
we have to get out what &apos;s going on here .
-I &apos;m sorry I interfered .
-I thought I had it under control .
you have to learn to set priorities .
sometimes it hurts .
-I am not suitable for the leader .
-Yes , you do .
Thanks to your quick response , Lotor did not escape with the Teludav .
you grab that .
the black lion has chosen you .
I am proud of you .
I only know that these people had the right access codes .
you must believe me !
I do . Nevertheless , you have to pay for your failure .
Ulaz ?
Operation Curon , phase one successful .
Start phase two .
Come on !
Come on !
Message to the command center .
Operation Curon , phase three has started .
General Rath ...
-I have an order for you .
-I am in the service of Galra .
Lotor &apos;s perception is not so clear since he returned .
it was risky to bring him back after the absence .
I am worried about the path he has been leading us since then .
you have to keep an eye on it .
Follow his battlecruiser and tell me any suspicious behavior .
Vrepit sa .
what killed you ?
Help .
that must be the one who crashed with his pod .
Experiment Y0XT39 reacts normally to optical stimuli .
approved for surgery curon .
-What does he say ?
-hard to say , but he comes out .
-What is this sound ?
-I look .
he wakes up .
-Have you put the clrule on him ?
-Which ones ?
otherwise his arm will turn into a weapon .
-the red ?
-we have only one clamp !
Where am I ?
why am I tied ?
-Do we eat it ?
-he doesn &apos;t look like a galala .
-Then we do not eat it ?
-No .
-I am not a galala .
-All the worse .
a traitor .
I am not ...
you are ...
you are rebels .
right .
we are fighting against the Galra .
we did not ally ourselves with them !
I &apos;m not working for them .
I am on your side .
I am Shiro , a paladin of Voltron .
but I was captured .
I assume .
-I fought against Zarkon .
-Against Zarkon ?
Of course , and I am the Phloban of Gargalax .
please , have you never heard of Voltron ?
the lion .
what happened to them ?
How much time has passed ?
the Galra have been sending spies to us for years .
and now they have sent you to listen to us ?
a joke .
No , I fled .
you fled from a Galra -@ battleship ?
-I won &apos;t buy it from you !
-it is true .
I took a pod .
They shot me at and hit my pod .
they do not do that with allies .
please . check my identity at the blade of Marmora or at Voltron .
-with a traceable signal ? No .
-Turn around .
our supplies here are limited .
we like to watch you starve until you finally tell the truth .
Prince Lotor , the scanners recognize an anomaly again .
exact coordinates .
I want to see them .
nothing .
What do you expect ?
three such phenomena in one day cannot be a coincidence .
Persecutors ? -We would know .
-except they have the scanners -@ protocols .
-Then they distort the measurements .
-Only the Galra can access them .
activates the heat -@ sensors and fires around the anomaly .
Why ?
we shoot them down !
I want to know who that is .
it is a Galra -@ battleship .
we bring our guest on board .
No !
Lotor needs support on Thayserix .
we are waiting for you immediately here .
-Thayserix ?
Where is that ?
-Not far away from here .
They cross the quadrant .
Take this with the Klygarg .
I hate the Klygarg .
how does it work again ?
enter your password . -Sure .
What is my password ?
-do not know it &apos;s yours !
I catch another message .
-Also record them .
-I didn &apos;t even record the first .
Prince Lotor gave us an order .
we should intercept Voltron .
Voltron ?
see if he is ready to speak .
Vakala !
Come here !
we should have eaten him .
he is injured .
it can &apos;t be far .
I &apos;m looking outside , you in the tunnels .
I will not hurt you !
please do not shoot !
you never meet !
let me ! -here with it !
-No , it belongs to me !
stop immediately , otherwise I will shoot !
you are on the wrong side of the war .
No , that is not true .
I am on your side .
my name is Shiro , and as I said , I am a paladin of Voltron .
it doesn &apos;t matter what I say . You don &apos;t believe me , so ...
I have to go back to my team , and I need your help .
Thayserix .
a gigantic gas planet .
According to the news we intercepted , Voltron is there ... or he was there .
-I have to go there .
are you having a ship ?
-Just a shuttle to dock on ships in orbit , not to cross the universe .
here , excuse me for hanging you on my wrist .
Thank you .
I &apos;m sorry that the gun hit your face .
Oh , that was neither the first nor the last time .
Shiro , I don &apos;t see a way for you to Thayserix .
-What about the Galra -@ Kreuzer ?
-What about him ?
he flies close by , I smugglgle myself on board .
on board a Galra -@ cruiser ?
you first got a Galra -@ ship . and now you want to break into one ?
you are crazier than me .
and I live voluntarily on an ice planet .
is it possible or not ?
the cruiser is within reach , but he jumps into the Hyper -@ Drive .
I hurry up .
Thank you for your help .
whether he makes it to the battleship and then to Voltron ?
he is the one he pretends to be , he has a chance .
you know this was our only ship ?
the cruiser identifies the shuttle as soon as it is within range .
because the shuttle is so small , the bridge is not informed .
the defense system destroys everything in visual contact .
the sensors identify you as space debris .
you have to be fast .
go to the blasters .
there you come on board .
the weapons are retracted in front of the Hyper -@ Drive .
Hyper -@ Drive . Enable shields .
an attack !
Visual contact to Voltron .
Voltron is within reach .
Voltron .
Hunting squadron one ready for use .
is already coming .
sends the fighter squadron .
go !
Voltron is out of reach .
Jagdgeschwader , Aktion abbrechen .
Cancel action .
now or never .
Voltron !
go , movement !
he is too fast for me !
No !
keep your henchmen off my neck .
Just like your father . The Galra -@ Imperium needs clear guidance in these difficult times .
I am the ruler .
but I am not my father .
Pilots -@ logbook .
I am a day away from Thayserix .
I have lost visual and radar contact with Voltron .
I keep my course .
I am four days from Thayserix .
no food or water .
SOS -@ signal is enabled .
no signs from anyone .
I am on the road for seven days .
the oxygen is running out , the fuel is consumed .
this will be my last entry .
What &apos;s going on ?
we have found it .
Master , I ask for forgiveness , but I know no other way .
Your empire needs you .
there we fought , there were his generals , and he stole the meteorite .
Lotor could be anywhere .
Without knowing what he is up to do , we never find him .
what are the connections ?
why is Voltron made of the same material as the meteorite ?
what is so special about it ?
Father discovered a meteorite before my birth .
Your father . and Zarkon .
when Zarkon was paladin of the black lion ?
even before .
before Alfor built the lions .
it hurts to talk about it , but since we want to stop the lottery , we have to hear the rest .
In the beginning , the paladins were five great leaders , although they came from cultures that were very different and had been waging war for generations , they settled their differences to protect their common interests .
which in the beginning was more of a special purpose alliance in the beginning , developed into a friendship .
a League of warrior had arisen , and together they kept away from those who would harm them .
Oje .
I keep warn you of going alone , Alfor .
as an alchemist , you are much wiser than as a soldier .
but I have you , Zarkon .
the original paladins were Zarkon of Daibazaal ,
King Alfor of Altea , Gyrgan of Rygnirath ,
Trigel of Dalterion -@ belt and Blaytz by Nalquoud .
Sit down , eat and drink with you !
Fraternization with the servant class is not allowed .
because of the discipline .
a little less discipline would do you good , Zarkon .
I think when Lambonite surround you -@ looters surround you .
-I had the gang under control .
-the gang had you under control .
why do I just get involved with these crooks ?
because we are the only crooks on your side .
on us !
at Rygnirath .
They did not suspect that after that night the universe would be different forever .
we evacuated all Galra -@ inhabitants at the crater .
-What did you find out ?
-I do not know .
this meteorite is different from the others .
-Being material changes the realities .
-What do you mean by that ?
Scholars have always had the theory that several realities exist .
whole other universes with stories of which we know nothing about .
but you could never prove it .
so far , because when we moved the meteorite we discovered this here .
this is another reality ?
-What is it ?
-No fear .
this is Kova .
-it comes from our reality .
-Zarkon . This is Honerva .
She is the best alchemist of Altea .
I invited them to Daibazaal . as research director .
Their expertise is priceless .
Isn &apos;t that exciting ?
it could turn the understanding of the universe upside down .
well , find out everything you can .
I give you all support .
I have to go .
that was short .
King Alfor experimented with the ore on Altea , while Honerva continued to study the abyss on Daibazaal .
but Alfor often came to visit , and the years passed .
Zarkon . this is Princess Allura .
very pleased .
a gift in honor of your birth , princess .
Honerva has probably tamed you .
I never thought that the great warrior would marry Zarkon , as well as an ancient tean alchemist .
Honerva , diligent as always .
Thanks for the gift .
Allura likes it .
-That was just a common gesture .
-Of course .
-What makes the quintessence of -@ experiment ?
-it is running .
one year with a drop of quintessence , without losing revolutions per debosch .
there is no comparable energy source .
my ships work according to the same principle . the ore develops almost by itself .
it &apos;s somehow terrifying .
infinitely strong spaceships for the Galra -@ Imperium .
and an endless source of clean energy for the universe .
of course .
What is it ?
I sent signals to the neighbor -@ reality . and this creature reacted .
nothing of our universe survived the passage through the transition .
-but this being came through unscathed .
-What ?
I thought we wanted to be careful .
we don &apos;t know what &apos;s out there .
earlier it was believed that lightnings came from the arrows of the gods until others was proved .
in our pursuit of knowledge , we penetrate into dangerous terrain .
Alfor and Honerva erected a particle -@ barrier around the crater to stop the creatures .
but she would not last forever .
the barrier becomes weaker .
we have little time .
When the creatures come out , my troops are overrun .
my planet , my people .
-Alfor &apos;s project will save us .
-Let us hope .
I hope your plan works , Alfor .
at Rygnirath !
incredible .
Alfor , they are fantastic .
how do they work ?
I formed them from the meteorite -@ ore and quintessence .
impressive !
the alloy with the meteorite -@ ore makes it almost indestructible .
what armament do they have ?
now it becomes really interesting .
Altean alchemy can create great feats .
but when I tested my spaceship , I suddenly felt a kind of psychic connection .
how can I explain it ? the ship didn &apos;t just read my thoughts .
it communicated with me .
They develop .
we do not know their abilities , but we understand it over time .
with time ?
time is escaping , and we are standing here .
Creatures of another empire soon slaughter my people .
without these spaceships all hope is lost !
understand .
that will be hard work .
these are not ordinary spaceships .
you do not choose the lion .
the lion chooses you .
be careful at the beginning .
They have greater energy than anything you know .
lead the formation .
you understand the ships best .
I am an alchemist , not a military leader .
-I remain your right hand .
-now good .
on my sign , Paladins !
right Alfor and Blaytz !
left Trigel and Gyrgan !
Paladins , I fly ahead and distract him .
you others attack from all sides !
Fire !
fires on !
these stupid things block me !
Blaytz .
-Thank you , Alfor !
-Always like .
Head bick -@ screw !
-I do not meet !
-Retreat , paladins !
we are reforming .
is waiting !
we form a new formation .
-What ? why ?
-I don &apos;t know , but I feel it .
-ey , I feel it too !
-I too !
What is going on here ?
Voltron .
-Incredible , we made it !
-how did that come about ?
am I a leg ?
-these forces are just incredible .
-This is Voltron .
a sign !
well done , Trigel !
-it wants to crush us !
-we have to get rid of it !
I know what we &apos;re doing .
we seal the transition .
seal the transition ?
why ? he almost destroyed Daibazaal !
the creatures almost destroyed Daibazaal , but you defeated them .
Zarkon , you agree with me .
it must be sealed .
maybe not .
just see what we have won , Alfor .
your spaceships are the most powerful machines .
What else do we discover if we continue to work ?
you risk your planet , the whole solar system ? -What for ?
for more power ?
-you know it &apos;s about more .
we already have Voltron .
that &apos;s enough .
I &apos;m in charge here !
I &apos;m sorry , Alfor .
the work continues .
Honerva continued her experiments at the transition .
despite their differences , Zarkon , Alfor and the Paladins established a new era of peace and prosperity .
Voltron gained fame as a defender of the universe , and the legend arose that continues to this day .
I heard there were three more earthquakes .
Don &apos;t worry , I stabilize the planets -@ cohesion .
my scientists scanned Daibazaal .
the planet disintegrates .
the integrity ...
I am not breaking Honerva &apos;s work now .
She discovers more every day !
their team developed a space cruiser that is five times larger than our ships .
-but that &apos;s not all .
-Hello , Honerva .
it &apos;s Deca Durabolin -@ Phoebs .
I hope you don &apos;t come to finish my work .
This gap contains more knowledge and power than you can ever understand .
I &apos;m just worried about stability ...
is that Kova ?
how old is he now ?
28 Deca Durabolin -@ Phoebs .
after the creatures attacked , he fell ill .
but then I treated him with quintessence .
No .
he has revealed the truth to us .
Quintessence is so much more than you understand .
-It is life itself .
-you have gone too far .
you coward .
Honerva , you ...
you want to prevent enlightenment .
we should enlarge the passage .
with Voltron we facilitate access to the other reality .
this is insanity !
Quintessence poisoned your mind .
this is just the surface .
we can rule the universe ! -we can live forever !
we all !
-I don &apos;t want to be a part of this .
you are just a part of Voltron , Alfor .
do not hold us all out of fear .
Alfor , I lead the paladins !
you follow my commands !
Alfor !
Honerva ?
Honerva !
we have to ...
we must have it .
we must have it . come back .
-Come back .
-What is it , my beloved ?
Quintessence .
The quintessence is life .
into the transition .
what ?
we have to ... we have to ...
Voltron .
Voltron .
that is the only way .
Alfor tried to warn me , but I didn &apos;t hear .
now my wife has fallen sick , and my planet is about decay .
I implore you , my faithful companions , to accompany me on a dangerous mission .
we have to seal the transition . and Voltron has to do that .
we will help you .
I hope it &apos;s not too late to save my planet , and our friendship .
Alfort &apos;s compassion for his comrade blinded him to Zarkon &apos;s true plans .
according to Honerva , we can only close the transition with the power of the quintessence .
for this , we must first increase the opening .
-how should that work ?
-with a sword .
Make a sword !
-This is too difficult .
-Concentrate !
where are we ?
in transition .
No !
Zarkon , what are you planning ?
-we have to take them away here !
-Fast .
the creatures have returned !
everywhere !
Fire lasers !
Trial , grab them !
Gyrgan , Blaytz , tax missiles !
away here !
Zarkon &apos;s attempt to save Honerva was in vain .
both succumbed to the radiation overload of the quintessence .
Zarkon had deceived the paladins .
They had enlarged the transition , which further destabilized Daibazaal .
King Alfor was forced to evacuate the planet .
he made the transition in the only way he knew .
he destroyed the home of the Galra .
King Alfor held a state funeral for Zarkon and Honerva .
but what happened there , he could never have imagined .
-Where am I ?
-on board your ship , sir .
brings us home .
I can &apos;t , sir .
Daibazaal was destroyed .
my Galra -@ companions .
King Alfor of Altea has destroyed our planet .
he will pay dearly for his crimes .
join your Emperor !
Revenge will be ours !
Zarkon became evil par excellence , obsessed with quintessence .
for a new opening between realities he needed Voltron .
and so the war began .
the Galra followed their leader immediately and attacked .
the planets were not prepared for this .
soon they were all conquered , except for Altea .
in order not to drop Voltron into Zarkon &apos;s hands , the lions were sent to distant corners .
Zarkon raced with anger .
he killed King Alfor . He atoned for the loss of Daibazaal with the destruction of Altea .
So this is Lotor &apos;s plan .
to penetrate other universes . -to get the purest quintessence .
-no matter how . We have to stop him .
my husband , how could I forget that ?
you have brought me back to life .
now I get you back .
Since I know I would like Julia as a girlfriend , I want to look good whenever I see her .
so what is important to girls . but looking good is hard .
Well , look at one .
the rooster on a pedestal .
I mean your hairstyle .
that makes no sense .
I don &apos;t have a gooster -@ hairstyle .
Cocks do not even have hair .
They have a cockcomb of skin .
that &apos;s the red thing on their heads , isn &apos;t it ?
yes .
Hahnenkamm .
Funny word .
As for birds , chickens are not as cool as penguins , but they have interesting behaviors .
in a natural environment , the cock lures the hen to mating by spreading his feathers and performing a dance .
God .
- Leave that .
otherwise i rush too much .
- Why so terrible ?
yes .
Lemon cuts look very tasty .
Fingers away . they are for the group .
all clear .
they look fantastic .
he lowers a wing and dances in a circle around the female .
Shit , Casey .
this is a real man !
already fuagged , or are you still fumbling ?
yes , of course .
Casey is totally prudish .
She has&apos;t even kissed a guy .
you didn &apos;t tell anything about a friend .
why don &apos;t you tell me anything about it ?
he &apos;s not my friend , we just depend on .
with his penis .
Is that true ?
- Do you hang with his penis ?
- No , Sharice .
hau ab .
but encouraging girls to mmate or have as a girlfriend requires other skills .
research is necessary .
you can &apos;t just ask a girl for a date .
you have to learn important things about them beforehand .
what is your favorite lemmonade ?
the normal .
Do you like movies ?
Yes , I love movies .
Do you have fears or phobias ?
- No .
- What is your favorite -@ winter sports ?
Well , we were a few times snowshoeing .
&quot; we , &quot; so you and your mom .
me and my friend .
Snowshoeing was his idea .
I hate the cold .
You have a friend ?
Miles .
Anyway , it &apos;s great that you show interest in others .
we have worked on .
but let us come back to you .
So if Mr. Tan &apos;s voice bothers you ...
when I was excited or stressed as a child , I hit my head somewhere or shouted .
today I prefer substitutes .
Sam .
is everything all right ?
do you want to talk about ?
I should talk to Mom .
that &apos;s usually how it usually works , but Mom is with the group today .
maybe I can help .
I like a girl .
honestly ?
- That is good .
how is it like that ?
- She is smart , and she is pretty .
and she has a friend , Miles .
cursed Miles .
Well , that &apos;s crap .
but you know , this is not the end of the world .
Mom had one when I met her .
- In fact ?
- This guy , Gerald Redenbach .
he had a jeep and a golden retriever wearing a scarf .
She found him so cool .
and you have stretched out mom ?
so in the way
how ?
I was always close to her and was cute and charming .
- That worked ?
- Take the pudding sample .
- I don &apos;t like pudding .
- Forget the pudding .
the point is , you &apos;re young , Sam .
Relationships come and go .
She may have her friend this week and next week , who knows ?
do you understand ?
yes .
I keep myself available in case Miles goes away or dies .
or they separate amicably .
- Okay , that &apos;s how I do it .
- You should .
- I think it went well .
- Me too .
we are always talking about taking time for ourselves . I have done that .
I was at a dance class .
albern .
the teacher found I have talent .
really silly , but she said .
and that &apos;s crazy , but afterwards we went to a bar , and I met a guy .
not as you think .
I am married .
you know Doug .
not really , he never comes . That &apos;s not his thing .
but whose thing is that ?
we can &apos;t come here for fun .
nothing against you .
I like you all .
Marjorie , you .
So , Sam ...
Sam is ... He had a good week .
but the thing is that , I was in the bar and probably for the first time since Sam &apos;s diagnosis I was not worries or fear .
I just had fun with these unwild people who don &apos;t have the slightest to do with autism .
and again , I like you .
but this guy , this bartender is like that ....
his life is so crazy and daring and normal . you know ?
and I realized that the ...
Sam will never have such a life .
Loading ... About
I don &apos;t know , I ...
I made lemon slices , so grab calmly grab .
there is a little too much lemon in it .
your dad is right .
Girls are fair game until there is a wedding ring on their finger .
an engagement ring means it is ready for a mistake .
okay , that &apos;s perfect .
Take good care .
sometimes I wish I was as casual as Zahid .
of all I know , he is the most successful with girls .
that &apos;s how you do it .
I hide , because the guy wants to step in my ass , and he has a tattoo on his neck .
- How are you doing ?
How is Doug ?
- Oh , we went out .
that was a total disaster .
Whenever we have fun , I kinky .
stop .
you do that great .
It is noble that you abide with him , according to what he has done .
that &apos;s a long time ago .
how has Christopher done since he started attending regular school ?
he makes steps backwards .
- He has tantrums .
- Have you try music therapy ?
I met this woman last year at the autism -@ run , and I think I still have her card .
She has a real studio .
She has something from a punk rockcker , but she &apos;s for cuddle .
and ...
- Oh no .
- What is ?
my credit card .
- Block card .
- What &apos;s going on ?
I have to block the Visa -@ card .
I forgot them after dancing in the bar .
- You want to wear the sweater ?
- What &apos;s wrong with that ?
nothing , I just don &apos;t understand why you do so much sports when you don &apos;t see your great figure .
real ?
shall I get more slutker ?
- Why do you lock them ?
- Identity theft ?
that was a compliment .
you are wonderful under the monster .
Bye !
the bar is ten minutes away .
pick them up .
my To -@ do -@ list is already full enough .
we have everything debited automatically .
If we have to change that , ten more points will be added on the list .
- I get them .
it is on my way . - No .
do you know what ?
it was my fault .
- I am already doing that .
- Sure ?
I &apos;m sorry I was so snappy .
I don &apos;t hear it anymore .
Coach Briggs .
You wanted to talk to me ?
- Yes , come here .
Sit down . - Okay .
we have to talk .
when it comes to my suspension , I &apos;m really sorry .
really , the team is very important to me .
I would never do anything that harms him .
Gardner , look at this office .
my life is not great .
do you know what I really enjoy , next to my brother &apos;s failure ?
these are girls who have talent , just like you .
To take you in the selection was risky .
- I do not want to regret this .
- No .
if I can do something to make up for it ...
- How ... - There is something .
you have beaten the daughter of our greatest sponsor .
Her parents always charter the bus for the semifinals , not this year , unless you apologize to her .
apologize ?
She would have to apologize to Beth .
it &apos;s up to you .
your team will not be thrilled if there is no bus .
but don &apos;t worry .
Teen -@ girls always deal each other nicely and humely .
I should not have beat you , no matter how nasty you were , and I &apos;m sorry .
your eye looks better , almost normal .
you &apos;re shit in excuse .
Yes , I know .
everything cool again ?
Listen , I know your brother has big problems .
there is certainly a lot of anger .
Attach a stress ball .
I know you just apologize so that you can get the bus again .
from me .
you can have it .
but do not make great on the toilet .
Oh , and I &apos;ve heard you &apos;re with Evan Chapin .
that is full of courageous .
most would be afraid to get involved with him , you would not .
Bye .
- I need food allowance .
- I hate the slut .
Slut ?
do you think she &apos;s promiscuous ?
No , she just annoys .
Don &apos;t take everything literally , you idiot .
come to me if no one eats with you .
okay .
the lessons begin .
you want to relax your woman ?
have your GPS ready , I will take you to Vaginahausen .
- This is not a real place .
- Yes , and I am the mayor .
Step one : be megacharmant .
Julia , Roald Amundsen , fed weak sled dogs to strong ones during his expedition through the Antarctic to make it faster .
- He has made them cannibals .
what is your favorite food ?
Step two : find out what annoys her about her boyfriend .
but subtly precede .
Julia , what are Miles &apos; three biggest weaknesses ?
You can also name more than three .
and step three , the most important of all :
strawberries coated with chocolate .
makes girls sharp , and that is proven .
it would require empirical evidence .
for example , their panties on the floor of my kitchenette .
this is anecdotal and pseudo-scientific .
Get the fucking berries .
cool shirt .
the Pharcyde .
I saw them live in 1996 .
I was the whitest guy in the audience .
They are certainly the whitest everywhere .
- In five minutes we are open .
- I just want to pick up a credit card .
the name is Elsa Gardner .
that sounds like I &apos;m an ass , but I can only give it to the owner .
Vorschrift .
do you make an exception for someone who wants to score with his wife ?
we were only screed about it .
it is not possible .
come .
I will call them .
let it be confirmed by her .
I understand that .
Hey , darure .
What is there ?
I am in the bar to pick up your credit card .
Tell the guy here .
Well , she tells you .
Hello , Nick here .
there is no one &apos;s turn .
Hello ?
- So you don &apos;t help me ?
- Sorry , I can &apos;t .
Thank you very much .
do you know why Evan flew out of school ?
- Surely we do not know .
- But there are a lot of rumors .
it was said he sold the band Meth , so it &apos;s so bad .
I heard he was sleeping with CourtneyBsMom , and Courtney A saw her .
I heard on Halloween he went as a wolf and tore a sheep .
- That is not true .
- Some eat disgusting stuff .
it must have been bad , he was arrested .
- Arrested ?
- Yes .
did you not known ?
- Casey is only in the tenth .
- Yes , I forgot that .
the superstar is still a baby .
small baby .
Evidence is important for scientific discoveries .
Yo , Arlo .
but to really understand something , you have to ask questions .
Sorry .
I am the boy whose sister beat you .
you kissed Henry yesterday , and today you kiss Arlo .
I wanted to ask , how did he get you around ?
please be as concrete as possible .
Age , what is that ?
Bailey is the perfect test person as she is a slut .
do you researching how to stretse women ?
- Ingenious .
- Arlo , be nice .
- Do you want to lay a flat ?
- Nailing ?
- I don &apos;t think so .
What do you do ?
- No , he means Pussys .
I don &apos;t like cats .
I mean , cats are quite okay .
I prefer birds rather than cats . Especially the flightless birds are cool .
Which girls do you stand into ?
or do you want to pop flightless birds ?
of course not .
a person , a human girl .
- That &apos;s enough , people .
They think I don &apos;t realize when they laugh at me , but I do .
I just don &apos;t always know why , which somehow makes it worse .
just read it .
we keep it for ourselves .
does he get along with a girl like Bailey ?
trust me , man .
Who is it ?
we keep it for ourselves , right ?
Well , say yes .
- Tell us .
- Who is the lucky one ?
Let &apos;s go .
Man , leave him alone .
he is not quite together .
Adelie- , Zügel- , Kaiser- , Eselspinguin .
Adelie- , Zügel- , Kaiser- , Eselspinguin .
Schätzchen ?
- Hey , is everything fine ?
- No .
I had to pick him up .
there was an incident .
he has not yet said a word .
he has locked himself .
- No idea what &apos;s going on .
- We can get that .
Sam , can I come in ?
Treasure , thank God .
Are you doing well ?
I will talk to Dad .
really ?
clear .
safe .
of course .
we understand each other lately .
you wanted that ?
Yes , that &apos;s great .
very nice .
- Should I then ...
- Pick up your card in the bar .
and when you &apos;re back , we are either better or we really need you .
- Call when you need me .
has something happened at school ?
yes .
- Do you want to talk about it ?
now ?
I have made a plan , as you said , I have made a plan to steal a woman .
these were not exactly my words .
I just researched , and these guys laughed at me and asked questions , I don &apos;t know what was so funny .
They laughed more and more , and then Bailey ...
I am completely together .
really .
I know that .
some kids are assholes , Sam .
that &apos;s just like that .
but even the assholes get girlfriends .
everyone does themselves easily , but I don &apos;t .
that is not true .
Believe me , it &apos;s hard for everyone .
not for you .
you have stretched mom to the guy with a jeep .
I have probably presented this too simple .
when your mom got rid of the idiot , she let me flash off ten times . okay ?
that &apos;s how it works .
but one must not give up .
so could I make a girl to like me ?
of course .
then I need strawberries coated with chocolate .
Hey , Mr. Freigeist .
once again climbed up mountains again ?
I am sorry .
I confused you .
I forgot my card here .
Elsa Gardner .
Gardner .
please .
Yes , this is my card .
great .
Yes , that &apos;s why I was here , so ...
Sorry .
Is Nick there ?
- Is Nick there ?
- It must be somewhere here .
all clear , you get out now and give the girl the strawberries .
then it is on the turn .
you have done what you could .
get them to you .
yes , that &apos;s why we are here .
No , no .
No , Sam .
Sam .
No , Sam .
Sam .
- What are you doing ?
- What do you think ?
it is illegal to enter through windows .
I could not ring .
Her boyfriend has strange working hours . She doesn &apos;t like to ring because he could sleep .
one of their rules .
I like rules .
so things are clear .
before I do anything , I want to know all the rules .
you boyfriend ?
which teenagers live together ?
Julia is not a teenager .
It is 26 years and three quarters .
Julia , your therapist ?
let &apos;s disappear .
Come out .
go , we drive .
Let &apos;s go .
in the animal kingdom , attraction is a simple , biological fact .
we have to get away .
only people make it complicated .
Wow , this is a great garden .
you could set up a pool .
Adjustable pools are cheap .
you can build a terrace around , then it is almost like a real pool .
that &apos;s all I have to say about pools .
but ... Do you want to say something ?
okay .
Why did you fly out of school ?
what ?
that &apos;s you . everyone tells something else .
What did you do ?
the car stolen by the director ?
- Made in the laboratory coke ?
- No . - What happened then ?
- That does not matter .
is eternal .
- For me it plays a role .
- Why ?
I have enough trouble , and I could get it with you .
- Why don &apos;t you tell me ?
- It is stupid .
- Okay , go home .
- Come on .
I stole a tuba .
what ?
I stole a tuba .
and a trombet .
and then a few saxophones .
I broke into the rehearsal room and let a few instruments go with me .
I wanted to move them .
I had no good reason for it .
the rehearsal room was not completed .
that was the reason .
Anyway , no matter .
90 minutes later the cops were with me and handcuffed me .
and since I geniously stole the stuff out of my own school , I flew out .
that &apos;s it .
That &apos;s it . I hope you &apos;re satisfied .
is that your seriousness ?
were you stolen musical instruments ?
- You did ?
- I said yes , it is stupid .
- Why do you laugh ?
- Because this is for shooting .
because everyone thinks you &apos;re a blatant daredevil .
- How did you drag them away ?
- With my hand cart .
this is getting better and better .
I don &apos;t make you laughing at me .
I shouldn &apos;t have said it .
- I have to pick up my sister .
- I didn &apos;t want to ...
- Evan , wait .
- What ?
I know .
I should go .
this is really unfavorable timing , but I ...
Yes , you should .
- Yes .
go .
- Yes .
the arrow was pointed and sharp .
one might think that there are regulations that prohibit such a thing in public .
they are generally dangerous , aren &apos;t they ?
absolutely .
with you alcoholic people fire weapons through the area .
that &apos;s dangerous , isn &apos;t it ?
- Yes ?
- I do not arrive ... - What ?
- Well , your top is in the way .
of course .
then let &apos;s go .
okay .
I do wound ointment on it .
it has expired .
so what will not be bad .
Yes , they only have so much space on these small tubes that they indiscriminately print superfluous information .
I have never met anyone like you .
and that &apos;s it .
you can dress dressed .
we should exchange numbers .
in case of side effects of the expired ointment .
listen to you should forget the matter with Julia .
Why ?
on the one hand , it is much older than you .
and when you tell her what you feel , it is a conflict of interest , and she can no longer be your therapist .
- But I need her as a therapist .
then look for someone at your age .
a kind of exercise friend before I date Julia .
I wouldn &apos;t call it that way .
before Roald Amundsen crossed the Antarctica , he undertook practice tours in simpler terrain .
that is only logical .
if I have enough experience with other girls , Julia becomes my girlfriend and is no longer my therapist .
or you could find a girl of your age .
that would be ideal for you .
and these girls will like you .
this is a good advice , thank you .
at any time .
Hey , Dad , will you tell Mom this to Julia ?
- Would you like that ?
- No , thank you .
well , then it remains among us .
I don &apos;t want to state , but I had a really good day with Sam .
he is a good boy .
- What happened to your arm ?
- Nothing . That was a nail in the garage .
show him to me , then I &apos;ll beat him in .
- Have you done anything about it ?
- Yes , wound ointment .
She had expired , but ...
the stuff is not really going on .
it only loses effect .
What is it for ?
because I &apos;m such a good dad ?
- Yes , you are Superdad .
- Yes ? - Can I get a cape with the title ?
- Not now .
Turn up the light .
human behavior is less like that of a chicken than that of an albatross .
no matter how far he flies , he always returns home .
except , it flies too close over the water and is eaten by a tiger shark .
